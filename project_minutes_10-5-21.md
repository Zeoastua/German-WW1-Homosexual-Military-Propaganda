# Project Meeting: 10/5/21
Try to practice pushing and pulling on Git; details in Slack as well as the 
git-practice.md file on GitHub
 
Majority of discussion on direction of topic:

Regis mentions text "Sex and the Weimar Republic" he can consult for texts,
as well as consulting with a professor who he knows has experience with the
material we may want to use. Regis will speak with him tomorrow.
Regarding images: we may have to rethink using graphic heavy propaganda,
considering the challenge of marking them up. Choose our battles.

Best Practice: XML markup done by halfway point of project, about three and a 
half weeks from now.

We could change the focus of our topic to looking at specific texts from the 
Weimar Republic (1918-1933) and examining the rhetoric around the homosexual
rights movement. Magazines, like Die Freundschaft, could be an option since 
it is a text with history and can give us a throughline to potentially ask
questions like "How does the language of advocacy change?"
Regis is confident he can front load the team texts if we adjust our topic to
this. 
Team wants to help: rest of team agrees to try to find a text that can work.
Translated into English will be helpful, in a plain text doc and copyright
free. Avoid PDFs. Reaching out to a content librarian is an option to explore.

Backup to the Backup Topic: The Brothers Grimm and how it depicts the 
"deviant man"- one who doesn't fit status quo, feminized, etc. and their 
treatment. Regis finds a copyright free version from the LOC. Can be linked
directly into GitHub so we can all access. 

Marion suggests looking over past projects for their methodology in sourcing
and consulting Dr. Birnbaum for pointers too.

Tentative timeline:
Texts by Friday
Weekend: Update ReadMe
By next meeting: Do document analysis; figure out what we want to highlight,
then start a schema together at next meeting.

Marion goes over the Big Picture of the project: marking up docs, site
development, etc. Suggests using Project Boards on GitHub. Alexis will set up.

Wrap up:
Marion shows how to add labels to GitHub Issues.
Don't forget to respond to other teams' projects.
Quick discussion of HTML/CSS.

Closing thought:
Do not be daunted.
