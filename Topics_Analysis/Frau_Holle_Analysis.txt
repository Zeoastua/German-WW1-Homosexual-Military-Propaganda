Frau Holle Topic Modeling Analysis

English
The topic model presented three sets which spoke closely to the tale. Specifically, they were:
2	0.25	fall bloody head threw great faithfully served homesickness satisfaction kindly dipped completely spin ugly 
10	0.25	shake apples tree ripe cried pile gathered raining laden 
19	0.25	bread meadow back stuck burn i'll oven loaf stepped shining terrified 

These sets details the tale's investment in the work that the beautiful daughter did for Frau
Holle, and the homesickness that developed. They also speak to some of the tertiary
characters of the tale, which helped to reveal the character of the two sisters. Finally, 
the sets clue into the end result of the work done for Frau Holle, in which the sisters
had gold or pitch rained upon them.
