The Juniper Topic Modeling Analysis

English
The topic model presented three sets which spoke closely to the tale. Specifically, they were:

9: boy daughter home evil son wife crash school loved grimm arnim achim source death crushed teeth brought awhile mother's chopped 
17: woman fell fire standing peeling didn't type aarne-thompson versions world hair jumping dead cap floor flashed window lock chest die 
18: bird sing sang beautifully roof front give shoemaker lit asked neck ashliman's nice words linden mill feathers journeyman shirtsleeves doors 

The tale revolves around death, specifically the death of a mother, a son, and an evil stepmother. The topic model sets speak to this investment, invoking themes of death, such as "die," "death," "chopped," (the brother was decapitated), "crushed," (the evil 
stepmother was crushed), and simply, "dead." Concerning topic model set 18, the set speaks to the nature of the dead brother, who becomes a bird and sings ("sing," "sang," beautifully,") the sins of his stepmother to people in the village. The set invokes 
settings within the village as well, such as "mill," as well as people he sang to, such as "shoemaker."
