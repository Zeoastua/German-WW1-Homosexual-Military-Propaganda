				<h3>how we did it</h3>
				<p>In order to analyze our text, we created a Relax NG schema to define the elements and attributes of our XML. These elements and attributes were created to have the ability to markup the Ashliman translations and 
					the original German Tales. Our focus is to tag the women in these tales. By doing this, we are able to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of how the women are characterized, such as “good“ vs. “evil“, in the simpliest terms.
					
					The Tales that we analyzed are as follows:
					English:
					Cinderella
					Frau Holle
					Hansel and Gretel
					Little Red Cap
					Little Snow White
					Rapunzel
					Sweetheart Roland
					The Juniper Tree
					The Six Swans
					The Twelve Brothers
					
					German:
					Cinderella
					Frau Holle
					Hansel and Gretel 
					Little Red Cap
					Rapunzel
					Sneewittchen
					Sweetheart ROland
					The Six Swans 
					The Twelve Brothers
