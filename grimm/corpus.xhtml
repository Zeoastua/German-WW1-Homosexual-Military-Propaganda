                <p>Hello! I see you must be interested in how women are affected in the tellings of Grimm's Fairy Tales. As you can see above this text, those are our stories.
                You can click on any of them and it will take you to a new page where you will see two versions of the story that you chose. One story will be in German and one will be in English.
                We wanted to show the difference in hostile, benevolent, and neutral interactions when they have to do with the women in the stories.</p>
                <p>When looking at the texts you will see colors:</p>
                <p>Hostile is red.</p>
                <p>Benevolent is indigo.</p>
                <p>Neutral is green.</p>
                <p>Feel free to browse and see how if you can find any differences!</p>
