    Overview
        Our project consists of a thorough analysis of the Grimm Fairy Tales in order to find connections between the "good" vs. the "evil" mother-figure. In order to do this,
        we characterized and tagged all women mentioned, tagged all actions,and tagged all dialogue. Our main goals were to 1) What types of mother figures are represented and what defines them 
        2) find differences between the "good" vs the "evil" mother-figure 3) Does the English version accurately translate the 1812 German text? 4) If there are differences, what are they?
        Our analysis of the ten different German and the translated English Tales allowed us to answer some of these questions and to pose a few more.
