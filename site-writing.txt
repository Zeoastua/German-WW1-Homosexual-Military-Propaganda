    Overview
        Our project consists of a thorough analysis of the Grimm Fairy Tales in order to find connections between the "good" vs. the "evil" mother-figure. In order to do this,
        we characterized and tagged all women mentioned, tagged all actions,and tagged all dialogue. Our main goals were to 
        1) What types of women figures are represented and what defines them 
        2) find differences between the "good" vs the "evil" mother-figure 
        3) Does the English version accurately translate the 1812 German text? 
        4) If there are differences, what are they?
        Our analysis of the ten different German and the translated English Tales allowed us to answer some of these questions and to pose a few more.

    The Grimm Brothers, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhem (1786-1859)Grimm were born into a fairly wealthy family, until their father died in 1796 their father died. After this, they were forced 
    to pave their own path. The brothers attended the University of Marburg and were to study law and continue their civic duty, like their father, but their love for language and country
    overtook their interests.
