    Overview
        Our project consists of a thorough analysis of the Grimm Fairy Tales in order to find connections between the “good“ vs. the “evil“ mother-figure. In order to do this,
        we characterized and tagged all women mentioned, tagged all actions,and tagged all dialogue. Our main goals were to investigate and answer these questions:
        1) What types of women figures are represented and what defines them 
        2) find differences between the “good“ vs the “evil“ mother-figure 
        3) Does the English version accurately translate the 1812 German text? 
        4) If there are differences, what are they?
        Our analysis of the ten different German and the translated English Tales allowed us to answer some of these questions and to pose a few more.

About
    The Grimm‘s Fairy Tales were published in 1812 contained 86 tales, which were to pay tribute to the German culture. The goal for these stories was not for them to become bedtime stories. 
    During the early 1800s, the Napoleonic Wars inspired them to write and share these stores to display and preserve their heritage of their country. 
    
    The Grimm Brothers, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhem (1786-1859)Grimm were born into a fairly wealthy family, until their father died in 1796 their father died. After this, they were forced 
    to pave their own path. The brothers attended the University of Marburg and were to study law and continue their civic duty, like their father, but their love for language and country
    overtook their interests. 
    
    The tales have since been translated from German to English. The German Tales that have been explored are the orginial 1812 versions, and the equivalent English Tales that are explored are from 
    D. L. Ashliman, which were translated from 1998-2020. 
    
    The scope of this project is to compare the original German Tales to the translated English version. We are focusing on the female characters to determine these comparisons. A major distinction between these versions
    is the difference in time period. This leads us to answer questions, such as how are women portrayed differently, if they are? Our analysis of these tales have lead us to better understand how time and culture 
    is a factor in these versions of the Grimms‘ Fairy Tales.

Methodology 
    In order to analyze our text, we created a Relax NG schema to define the elements and attributes of our XML. These elements and attributes were created to have the ability to markup the Ashliman translations and 
    the original German Tales. Our focus is to tag the women in these tales. By doing this, we are able to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of how the women are characterized, such as “good“ vs. “evil“, in the simpliest terms.
    
    The Tales that we analyzed are as follows:
            English:
                Cinderella
                Frau Holle
                Hansel and Gretel
                Little Red Cap
                Little Snow White
                Rapunzel
                Sweetheart Roland
                The Juniper Tree
                The Six Swans
                The Twelve Brothers
               
            German:
                Cinderella
                Frau Holle
                Hansel and Gretel 
                Little Red Cap
                Rapunzel
                Sneewittchen
                Sweetheart ROland
                The Six Swans 
                The Twelve Brothers
         
    In order to come to any conclusions about the characterizations of women in these tales, we, first, needed to tag the metadata of each tale, including:
        <metadata><metadata>
        <title><title>
        <year><year>
        <author><author>
        <editor><editor>
        <translator><translator>
        <language><language>
        <number><number>

    The story and the tale itself is tagged using story and paragraph tags. 
    
    A character tag was used to tag only women, but every time a woman is referenced in the text. This is done using an element called “<character><character>“,
    with the attributes:
        @child-status -- in order to display if that character is a: “mother“ | “stepmother“ | “grandmother“ | “godmother“ | “adopted“ | “childless“
        @martial-staus -- in order to display if that character is a: “wife“ | “widow“ | “fiancee“ | “divorcee“ | “unmarried“
        @reference -- in order to individually refer to a character with a specific but original name, for each developer to remember the character by.
        
    All dialogue is tagged with the element, “<dialogue><dialogue>“ and includes:
        @speaker -- to name who is active in this dialogue
        @state-of-being -- in order to indicate the feeling behind the dialogue: “positive“ | “negative“ | “neutral“
        *The elements “<character><character>“ and “<act><act>“ can be present within the dialogue.
        
    All acts are tagged to emphasis interactions by the women characters, to the women characters, or because of the women characters with the “<act><act>“ element, including:
        @type -- in order to determine what kind of action: “being or “doing“
        @effect -- in order to describe how the interaction is perecived: “hostile“ | “benevolent“ | “ambiguous“
        @agent -- to indicate who is displaying the act
        *The attributes:
            @io -- the indirect object of the act
            @receiver -- the character who is being acted on
   
This markup allows the project‘s developers to collect data to indicate the quantity and what kinds of women are included in each of the tales.
Since this data is collected, the comparison between the original German and the translated English tales is possible.
Differences and similarities are displayed between each tale‘s characterization of women.
