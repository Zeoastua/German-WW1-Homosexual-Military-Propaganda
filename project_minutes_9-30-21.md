# Project Meeting 9/30/21

Discussed the important of weekly project updates as it concerns course grade.

Alexis Moffa volunteered to write up the project's weekly posting.

Reassurance that project is daunting, but done incrementally, it will become something beautiful, and that it is okay to be confused.

Everyone ensured they were on the Github.

Covered the operating system for our computers, all project members except for Marion uses Windows.

Project members installed Git.

We then worked to understand command prompt.

There became need for troubleshooting with Darian's command prompt, and Marion intends to reach out to Dr. Birnbaum and Evan.

We decided to collectively use Gitbash instead of Command Prompt.

We configured SSH keys through much effort and confusion.

God is a Woman.

The Repo was copied as a local file, and ```git pull``` was understood.
