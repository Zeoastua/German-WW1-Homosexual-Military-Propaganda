# Project Meeting: 10/19/2021

Document Talk:
Regis needs to adjust his German XML doc due to character replacement making it
unreadable. Will look into using Regex to temporarily replace in document so 
he can move forward. 

Schema Talk: lots of it...

Keeping author: the German Grimm's lists the brothers as the authors. Required.
Adding editor since some German tales have an editor and English versions 
can note Grimms here. 

Make translator optional.

Class attribute: broken into two new attributes- "child-status" and "marital
status". First can contain mother, stepmother, grandmother, godmother, adopted,
all optional. Notes relationship to child in text. 
Second can contain wife, widow, fiancee, divorcee. All optional. Notes 
relationship to men in the story.

Add a number element to the metadata.

Cut emotion element. 
"stateofbeing": change from element to attribute. On action element, notes
external and internal states of character doing the action. 

Add "agent" attribute to note who performs an action

Add "receiver" attribute to note who receives an action.

Dialogue element can also have "stateofbeing" attribute for emotions.

Marion reminds us to associate the schema to our XML docs asap.

Set goal for markup to be done by November 2.

Back to Document talk: 
Need to replace 3 stories from original selection; Regis' version only goes
to coincide with the German text. 
Sweetheart Roland (56), The Six Swans(49) and The Little Red Cap (26)
will be added. Victoria will take Roland and Darian will take the other two.

Regis sets a goal to finish marking up 5 stories by next meeting or we can
yell at him. Rest of team sets goal to mark up their longest one by next 
meeting.
Alexis will upload the new stories and make the project update for Friday. 

For next week:
Marion would like us to start wireframing our visions of the site. 
Regis is inspired by the Russian fairy tales project and Darian's HTML 
featured in class with graphic background. He's thinking forest and a natural
color palatte: greens, tan, brown. Possibly adding illustrations for the 
each tale that clicks to the text. Think of menus, buttons, boxes, etc. 

Mid-Term Task:
Markup will hopefully be done. Each individual has a task to accomplish:
Alexis: research on topic, write up texts for pages like about, methodology.
Website Development will go to Victoria (HTML) and Darian (CSS). 
Regis: topic modelling. Will consult Evan and others on process. 

We did the thing.
