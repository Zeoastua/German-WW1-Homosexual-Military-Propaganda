## Recap: How to Push/Pull
Whenever you want to work in your local repository, you have to make sure you have the most recent version by pulling first. You can use `git pull` within the repo directory on your computer to pull the latest changes from GitHub. __Always pull before making any edits!__

After you make edits, you have to push them to the GitHub repository so that your teammates can see them! You can use `git status` to check if you have any changes that need to be pushed. You first need to write ` git add FILE-NAME-HERE` to stage your file so it's ready to be committed. To commit those changes to be pushed, write `git commit -m "TYPE-MESSAGE HERE"` with a note detailing what you've done in that edit. This is for tracking purposes, so you can easily remember what you did in a given commit! Finally, you can push your local changes to the GitHub repository with `git push` and you're done! __Always push after making changes!__

## Push/Pull Practice
Write a message in the space below your name, and push it so that your teammates can receive it! Make sure to keep in touch with each other over Slack and let your team know when you've made changes so that they know to pull.
