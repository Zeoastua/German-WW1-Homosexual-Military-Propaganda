            <p>
                <act type="being" effect="ambiguous" agent="widow">A widow had two daughters, the
                    one was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy.</act>
                <act effect="ambiguous" type="being" agent="widow">She greatly favored the ugly,
                    lazy girl, because she was her own daughter.</act>
                <act type="doing" agent="pretty girl" effect="hostile">And the other one had to do
                    all the work, and be the Cinderella of the house.</act>
            </p>
            <p>
                <act effect="hostile" agent="pretty girl" type="doing">Every day the poor girl had
                    to sit by a well, next to the highway, and spin so much that her fingers
                    bled.</act>
                <act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="pretty girl">Now it happened that one day
                    the reel was completely bloody, so she dipped it in the well, to wash it off,
                    but it dropped out of her hand and fell in.</act>
                <act effect="hostile" type="doing" agent="pretty girl" receiver="widow">She cried,
                    ran to her stepmother, and told her of the mishap.</act>
                <act effect="hostile" agent="widow" type="doing" receiver="pretty girl">She scolded
                    her so sharply, and was so merciless that she said,</act>
                <dialogue speaker="widow" stateofbeing="negative">"Since you have let the reel fall
                    in, you must fetch it out again."</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><act effect="hostile" type="doing" agent="pretty girl">Then the girl went back to the
                    well, and did not know what to do. Terrified, she jumped into the well to get
                    the reel. She lost her senses.</act><act effect="benevolent" type="doing"
                    agent="pretty girl">And when she awoke and came to herself again, she was in a
                    beautiful meadow where the sun was shining, and there were many thousands of
                    flowers. She walked across this meadow and came to an oven full of bread.</act>
                <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="bread" receiver="pretty girl">The bread
                    called out</act>, <dialogue speaker="bread" stateofbeing="negative">"Oh, take me
                    out. Take me out, or I'll burn. I've been thoroughly baked for a long
                    time."</dialogue>
                <act effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl" type="doing" receiver="bread">So she
                    stepped up to it, and with a baker's peel took everything out, one loaf after
                    the other.</act></p>
            <p>
                <act effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl" type="doing">After that she walked
                    further and came to a tree laden with apples.</act>
                <dialogue speaker="apple tree" stateofbeing="negative">"Shake me. Shake me. We
                    apples are all ripe."</dialogue>
                <act effect="hostile" agent="apple tree" type="doing">cried the tree.</act>
                <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl">So she shook the tree until
                    the apples fell as though it were raining apples. When none were left in the
                    tree, she gathered them into a pile, and then continued on her way.</act>
            </p>
            <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl">Finally she came to a small
                    house.</act>
                <act effect="ambiguous" agent="old woman" type="doing">An old woman was peering out
                    from inside.</act>
                <act effect="ambiguous" type="being" agent="old woman">She had very large
                    teeth,</act>
                <act effect="hostile" type="being" agent="pretty girl">which frightened the girl,
                    </act><act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="pretty girl">and she wanted to
                    run away.</act> But the old woman called out to her,<dialogue
                    speaker="old woman" stateofbeing="positive">"Don't be afraid, dear child. Stay
                    here with me, and if you do my housework in an orderly fashion, it will go well
                    with you. Only you must take care to make my bed well and shake it diligently
                    until the feathers fly, then it will snow in the world.* I am Frau
                    Holle."</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>
                <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="pretty girl" io="old woman">Because the
                    old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took heart, agreed, and started in
                    her service. The girl took care of everything to Frau Holle's satisfaction and
                    always shook her featherbed vigorously until the feathers flew about like
                    snowflakes. Therefore she had a good life with her: no angry words, and boiled
                    or roast meat every day.</act>
            </p>
            <p>
                <act effect="hostile" agent="pretty girl" type="being">Now after she had been with
                    Frau Holle for a time, she became sad.</act>
                <act effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl" type="being">At first she did not know
                    what was the matter with her, but at last she determined that it was
                    homesickness.</act>
                <act effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl" type="being">Even though she was many
                    thousands of times better off here than at home, still she had a yearning to
                    return.</act>
                <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="pretty girl" receiver="old woman"
                    >Finally she said to the old woman,</act>
                <dialogue speaker="pretty girl" stateofbeing="negative">"I have such a longing for
                    home, and even though I am very well off here, I cannot stay longer. I must go
                    up again to my own people."</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>
                <act effect="ambiguous" agent="old woman" type="doing">Frau Holle said,</act>
                <dialogue speaker="old woman" stateofbeing="positive">"I am pleased that you long
                    for your home again, and because you have served me so faithfully, I will take
                    you back myself."</dialogue>
                <act effect="benevolent" agent="old woman" type="doing" receiver="pretty girl">With
                    that she took her by the hand and led her to a large gate.</act>
            </p>
            <p>
                <act effect="benevolent" type="doing" agent="gate" receiver="pretty girl">The gate
                    was opened, and while the girl was standing under it, an immense rain of gold
                    fell, and all the gold stuck to her, so that she was completely covered with
                    it.</act>
                <dialogue speaker="old woman" stateofbeing="positive">'This is yours because you
                    have been so industrious,"</dialogue>
                <act type="doing" effect="benevolent" agent="old woman" receiver="pretty girl">said
                    Frau Holle, and at the same time she gave her back the reel which had fallen
                    into the well.</act>
            </p>
            <p>
                <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl">With that the gate was
                    closed and the girl found herself above on earth, not far from her mother's
                    house.</act>
                <act effect="ambiguous" agent="rooster" type="doing">And as she entered the yard the
                    rooster, sitting on the well, cried:</act>
            </p>
            <p>
                <dialogue speaker="rooster" stateofbeing="positive">Cock-a-doodle-doo, Our golden
                    girl is here anew.</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>
                <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl">Then she went inside to her
                    mother, and as she arrived all covered with gold, she was well received, both by
                    her mother and her sister. The girl told all that had happened to her, and when
                    the mother heard how she had come to the great wealth, she wanted to achieve the
                    same fortune for the other, the ugly and lazy daughter.</act>
                <act effect="hostile" agent="ugly girl" type="doing">She made her go and sit by the
                    well and spin. And to make her reel bloody, the lazy girl pricked her fingers
                    and shoved her hand into a thorn bush. Then she threw the reel into the well,
                    and jumped in herself.</act>
            </p>
            <p>
                <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="ugly girl">Like the other girl, she too
                    came to the beautiful meadow and walked along the same path.</act>
                <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="ugly girl" io="bread">When she came to
                    the oven, the bread cried again,</act>
                <dialogue speaker="bread" stateofbeing="negative">"Oh, take me out. Take me out, or
                    else I'll burn. I've been thoroughly baked for a long time."</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p><act effect="ambiguous" agent="ugly girl" type="doing">But the lazy girl
                    answered</act>, <dialogue speaker="ugly girl" stateofbeing="negative">"As if I
                    would want to get all dirty," and walked away.</dialogue></p>
            <p>
                <act effect="hostile" agent="apple tree" type="doing">Soon she came to the apple
                    tree. It cried out,</act>
                <dialogue speaker="apple tree" stateofbeing="negative"> "Oh, shake me. Shake me. We
                    apples are all ripe."</dialogue>
            </p>
            <p>
                <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="ugly girl">But she answered,</act>
                <dialogue stateofbeing="negative" speaker="ugly girl">"Oh yes, one could fall on my
                    head,"</dialogue>
                <act effect="ambiguous" agent="ugly girl" type="doing">and with that she walked
                    on.</act>
            </p>
            <p>
                <act type="being" effect="ambiguous" agent="ugly girl">When she came to Frau Holle's
                    house, she was not afraid, because she had already heard about her large
                    teeth,</act>
                <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="ugly girl">and she immediately began to
                    work for her. On the first day she forced herself, was industrious, and obeyed
                    Frau Holle, when she said something to her, because she was thinking about all
                    the gold that she would give her. But on the second day she already began to be
                    lazy, on the third day even more so, and then she didn't even want to get up in
                    the morning. She did not make the bed for Frau Holle, the way she was supposed
                    to, and she did not shake it until the feathers flew.</act>
                <act effect="hostile" agent="old woman" type="being">Frau Holle soon became tired of
                    this</act>
                <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="old woman" receiver="ugly girl">and
                    dismissed her of her duties.</act>
                <act effect="hostile" agent="ugly girl" type="doing">This was just what the lazy
                    girl wanted, for she thought that she would now get the rain of gold.</act>
            </p>
            <p>
                <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="old woman" receiver="ugly girl">Frau
                    Holle led her too to the gate.</act>
                <act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="gate" receiver="ugly girl">She stood
                    beneath it, but instead of gold, a large kettle full of pitch spilled over
                    her.</act>
                <dialogue speaker="old woman" stateofbeing="negative">"That is the reward for your
                    services,"</dialogue>
                <act agent="old woman" type="doing" effect="hostile">said Frau Holle, and closed the

            </p>
            <p>
                <act agent="ugly girl" type="doing" effect="hostile">Then the lazy girl went home,
                    entirely covered with pitch.</act>
                <act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="rooster">As soon as the rooster on the

                <act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="ugly girl">And the pitch stuck fast to
