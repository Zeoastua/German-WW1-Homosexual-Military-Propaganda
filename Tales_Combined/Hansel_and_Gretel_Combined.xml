                name was Gretel. He had but little to eat, and once, when a great famine came to the
                land, he could no longer provide even their daily bread.</p>

                    work. They will not find their way back home, and we will be rid of

            <p>Vor einem großen Walde wohnte ein ar- mer Holzhacker, der hatte nichts zu beißen und
                zu brechen, und kaum das tägliche Brod für seine <character child-status="mother"
                    marital-status="wife" reference="mother">Frau</character> und seine zwei Kinder,
                Hänsel und <character child-status="childless" marital-status="unmarried"
                    reference="gretel">Gretel</character>. Einmal konnte er auch das nicht mehr
                schaffen, und wußte sich nicht zu helfen in seiner Noth. Wie er Abends vor Sorge
                sich im Bett herumwälzte, da sagte seine <character child-status="mother"
                    marital-status="wife" reference="mother">Frau</character> zu ihm: <dialogue

                    und laß sie dort, wir kön- nen sie nicht länger ernähren.“</dialogue>
                <dialogue speaker="father" stateofbeing="negative">„Nein <character

                    bringen, meine eigenen lieben Kinder zu den wilden Thieren zu führen, die sie
                    bald in dem Wald zerreißen würden.“</dialogue>
                <dialogue speaker="mother" stateofbeing="negative">„Wenn du das nicht thust, sprach

            <p>Die zwei Kinder waren auch noch wach von Hunger, und hatten alles gehört, was die
                    <character child-status="mother" marital-status="wife" reference="mother"
                    >Mutter</character> zum Vater gesagt hatte. <character child-status="childless"

                ist es um mich geschehen und fing er- bärmlich an zu weinen, Hänsel aber sprach:

                Damit stieg er auf, zog sein Röcklein an, machte die Unterthüre auf und schlich
                hinaus. Da schien der Mond hell und die weißen Kieselsteine glänzten wie lauter Ba-
                tzen. Hänsel bückte sich und machte sich sein ganz Rocktäschlein voll davon, so viel
                nur hin- ein wollten, dann ging er zurück ins Haus: <dialogue speaker="hansel"
                    stateofbeing="neutral">„tröste dich, <character child-status="childless"

            <p>Morgens früh, ehe die Sonne noch aufge- gangen war, kam die <character

                    >Mutter</character> und weckte sie alle beide: <dialogue speaker="mother"
                    stateofbeing="neutral">„steht auf, ihr Kinder, wir wollen in den Wald gehen, da

                <character child-status="childless" marital-status="unmarried" reference="gretel"
                    >Gretel</character> nahm das Brod unter die Schürze, weil Hänsel die Stei- ne in
                der Tasche hatte, dann machten sie sich auf den Weg in den Wald hinein. Wie sie ein
                Weilchen gegangen waren, stand Hänsel still und guckte nach dem Haus zurück, bald
                darauf wieder und immer wieder. Der Vater sprach: <dialogue speaker="father"
                    stateofbeing="neutral">„Hänsel, was guckst du zurück und hältst dich auf, hab
                    Acht und marschir zu.“</dialogue>
                <dialogue speaker="hansel" stateofbeing="neutral">„Ach, Vater, ich seh nach meinem

                nicht nach dem Kätzchen gese- hen, sondern immer einen von den blanken Kiesel-
                steinen aus seiner Tasche auf den Weg geworfen.</p>

            <p>Wie sie mitten in den Wald gekommen waren, sprach der Vater, <dialogue
                    speaker="father" stateofbeing="neutral">„nun sammelt Holz, ihr Kinder, ich will
                    ein Feuer anmachen, daß wir nicht frieren.“</dialogue> Hänsel und <character

                    >Gretel</character> trugen Reisig zusammen, einen kleinen Berg hoch. Da steckten
                sie es an, und wie die Flamme recht groß brannte, sagte die <character

                    >Mutter</character>
                <dialogue speaker="mother" stateofbeing="neutral">„nun legt euch ans Feuer und
                    schlaft, wir wollen in dem Wald das Holz fällen, wartet, bis wir wieder kommen,
                    und euch abholen.“</dialogue></p>

            <p>Hänsel und <character child-status="childless" marital-status="unmarried"
                    reference="gretel">Gretel</character> saßen an dem Feuer, bis Mittag, da aß
                jedes sein Stücklein Brod, und dann wieder bis an den Abend; aber Va- ter und

                    >Mutter</character> blieben aus, und niemand woll- te kommen und sie abholen.
                Wie es nun fin- stere Nacht wurde, fing <character child-status="childless"
                    marital-status="unmarried" reference="gretel">Gretel</character> an zu weinen,
                Hänsel aber sprach: <dialogue speaker="hansel" stateofbeing="neutral">„wart nur ein
                    Weilchen, bis der Mond aufgegangen ist.“</dialogue> Und als der Mond aufgegangen
                war, <act type="doing" effect="benevolent" agent="hansel">faßte er die <character

                neugeschlagene Batzen und schimmerten und zeigten ihnen den Weg. Da gingen sie die
                ganze Nacht durch, und wie es Morgen war, kamen sie wieder bei ihres Vaters Haus an.
                Der Vater freute sich von Herzen, als er seine Kinder wieder sah, denn er hatte sie
                ungern allein gelassen, die <character child-status="mother" marital-status="wife"
                    reference="mother">Mutter</character> stellte sich auch, als wenn <character

            <p>Nicht lange darnach, war wieder kein Brod im Hause und Hänsel und <character

                    >Gretel</character> hörten wie Abends die <character child-status="mother"
                    marital-status="wife" reference="mother">Mutter</character> zum Vater sagte:

                gedachte, es wäre doch besser, wenn du den letzten Bissen mit deinen Kindern
                theiltest, weil er es aber einmal gethan hatte, so durfte er nicht nein sagen.
                Hänsel und <character child-status="childless" marital-status="unmarried"

                    reference="mother">Mutter</character> zu- geschlossen. Doch tröstete er die

                    reference="gretel">Gretel</character> und sprach: <dialogue speaker="hansel"

            <p>Morgens früh erhielten sie ihr Stücklein Brod, noch kleiner als das vorigemal. Auf
                dem Wege bröckelte es Hänsel in der Tasche, stand oft still, und warf ein Bröcklein
                an die Erde. <dialogue speaker="father" stateofbeing="neutral">„Was bleibst du immer

                <dialogue speaker="hansel" stateofbeing="neutral">„Ach! ich seh nach meinem

                    die auf den Schornstein oben scheint.“</dialogue> Hänsel aber zerbröckelte all
                sein Brod und warf die Bröcklein auf den Weg.</p>

            <p>Die <character child-status="mother" marital-status="wife" reference="mother"
                    >Mutter</character> aber führte <character child-status="mother"
                    marital-status="wife" reference="mother">sie</character> noch tiefer in den Wald
                hinein, wo sie ihr Lebtag nicht ge- wesen waren, da sollten sie wieder einschlafen
                bei einem großen Feuer, und Abends wollten die Eltern kommen und sie abholen. Zu
                Mit- tag theilte <character child-status="childless" marital-status="unmarried"
                    reference="gretel">Gretel</character> ihr Brod mit Hänsel, weil der seins all
                auf den Weg gestreut; der Mit- tag verging und der Abend verging, aber nie- mand kam
                zu den armen Kindern. Hänsel trö- stete die <character child-status="childless"
                    marital-status="unmarried" reference="gretel">Gretel</character> und sagte:
                    <dialogue speaker="hansel" stateofbeing="neutral">„wart, wenn der Mond aufgeht,

                sah, da waren sie weg, die viel tausend Vöglein in dem Wald, die hatten sie gefunden
                und aufgepickt. Hänsel meinte doch den Weg nach Haus zu finden und zog die

                    reference="gretel">Gretel</character> mit sich, aber sie ver- irrten sich bald
                in der großen Wildniß und gingen die Nacht und den ganzen Tag, da schliefen sie vor
                Müdigkeit ein; und gingen noch einen Tag, aber sie kamen nicht aus den Wald heraus,
                und waren so hungrig, denn sie hatten nichts zu essen, als ein paar kleine Beer-
                lein, die auf der Erde standen.</p>

            <p>Am dritten Tage gingen sie wieder bis zu Mittag, da kamen sie an ein Häuslein, das
                war ganz aus Brod gebaut und war mit Ku- chen gedeckt, und die Fenster waren von
                hellem Zucker. <dialogue speaker="hansel" stateofbeing="neutral">„Da wollen wir uns
                    niedersetzen und uns satt essen, sagte Hänsel; ich will vom Dach essen, iß du

                    >Gretel</character> schon ein paar runde Fensterscheiben gegessen, und brach
                sich eben eine neue aus, da hörten sie eine feine Stimme, die von innen herausrief:

                    >Gretel</character> erschracken so gewaltig, daß sie fallen ließen, was sie in
                der Hand hielten, und gleich darauf sahen sie aus der Thüre eine kleine steinalte
                    <character child-status="childless" marital-status="unmarried" reference="witch"
                    >Frau</character> schleichen. <character child-status="childless"
                    marital-status="unmarried" reference="witch">Sie</character> wackelte mit dem

                ward gutes Essen aufgetragen, Milch und Pfannkuchen mit Zucker, Aepfel und Nüsse,
                und dann wurden zwei schöne Bettlein bereitet, da legten sich Hänsel und <character

            <p>Die <character child-status="childless" marital-status="unmarried" reference="witch"

                    marital-status="unmarried" reference="witch">sie</character> schon auf, ging an

                er da aufwachte, war er von einem Gitter umschlossen, wie man junge Hühn- lein
                einsperrt, und konnte nur ein paar Schritte gehen. Das <character
