                    bald und eine von euch wird Königin.“</dialogue> Da ging die älteste in ihre
                Kammer und probirte den Pantoffel an, die Fußspitze kam hinein, aber die Ferse war
                zu groß, da nahm sie das Messer und schnitt sich ein Stück von der Fer- se, bis sie
                den Fuß in den Pantoffel hinein- zwängte. So ging sie heraus zu dem Prin- zen, und
                wie der sah, daß sie den Pantoffel anhatte, sagte er, das sey die Braut, führte sie
                zum Wagen und wollte mit ihr fortfahren. Wie er aber ans Thor kam, saßen oben die
                Tauben und riefen: <dialogue speaker="pigeons" stateofbeing="negative">„Rucke di
                    guck, rucke di guck! Blut ist im Schuck: (Schuh) Der Schuck ist zu klein, Die
                    rechte Braut sitzt noch daheim!“</dialogue> Der Prinz bückte sich und sah auf
                den Pan- toffel, da quoll das Blut heraus, und da merk- te er, daß er betrogen war,
                und führte die fal- sche Braut zurück. Die <character child-status="stepmother"
                    marital-status="widow" reference="stepmother">Mutter</character> aber sagte zur
                zweiten Tochter: <dialogue speaker="stepmother" stateofbeing="neutral">„nimm du den
                    Pantoffel, und wenn er dir zu kurz ist, so schneide lieber vor- ne an den Zehen
                    ab.</dialogue> Da nahm sie den Pan- toffel in ihre Kammer, und als der Fuß zu
                groß war, da biß sie die Zähne zusammen und schnitt ein groß Stück von den Zehen ab,
                und drückte den Pantoffel geschwind an. Wie sie damit hervortrat, meinte er, das
                wäre die rech- te und wollte mit ihr fortfahren. Als er aber in das Thor kam, riefen
                die Tauben wieder: <dialogue speaker="pigeons" stateofbeing="negative">„Rucke di

                Strümpfe der Braut roth gefärbt und das Blut war hoch herauf gedrungen. Da brachte
                sie der Prinz der Mutter wieder und sagte: <dialogue speaker="prince"
                    stateofbeing="negative">„das ist auch nicht die rechte Braut; aber ist nicht
