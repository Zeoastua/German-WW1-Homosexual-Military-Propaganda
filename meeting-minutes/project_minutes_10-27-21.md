# Meeting Minutes 10/26/2021

This week, the team performed XML tagging on our first documents, which proved to be a bit
bumpy and led to the meeting starting off with lots of...
## Schema Talk
We overhauled the schema to ensure that all of us would be on the same page while we coded
independently and to add notes to offer guidance if we ran into questions. Details are in the
schema, but here are some highlights:

Element `action` converted to `act` to encompass an act of being and a physical act by a 
character

Added a `reference` attribute in `character` for tracking a character in the document. This is
up to the individual coder.

Added an `effect` and `io` attribute on `act`. `effect` tags the effect on an agent or 
receiver of an act; `io` tags an indirect object involved in an act. 

Team will edit coded documents with new schema. By November 2, all our documents will be 
coded.

We have 2 weeks to make the website for our project with a solid CSS and HTML
Goals for next week:
Darian & Victoria: draft of site by next week
Alexis: half of writings
Regis: proceed on topic modeling
