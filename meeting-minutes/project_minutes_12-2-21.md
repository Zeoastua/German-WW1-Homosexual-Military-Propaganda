# Project Meeting Minutes 12/2/2021

Marion reminds the Team that she has her office hours and to stop by in person and on Zoom
to work on any and everything with the project.

Alexis: Favicon is up and Little Red is back! She's the best...

Victoria: XSLT for transforming the stories into XHTML is underway. Can start processing other
stories with it when small edit made to code during meeting is confirmed to work to input
the English version. Juniper Tree will need its own XSLT since it will be only English. 
Will add templates to style `acts` by their attributes as well. 

Darian: Unfortunately, Darian was not well and could not make the meeting. Her tasks are to
complete entering the text from the site writing text file into the XHTML and continue to modify
CSS per last meeting minutes. One edit was done to the CSS during the meeting and pushed to the
repo to adjust the story grid columns. Team thinks the center of the text may have to be adjusted
or possibly the left-align.

Regis: Mallet drama today, but he quickly ran new keys. Topic Modeling gave us more on the 
translation than the role of women once analyzed. Is the team ok with that even though it is 
not the main research aim of the project. Team is fine with it...if Regis wants to adjust text
to focus more on women it should only be done if there is time. We can add the translation 
analysis and explain our process of using Mallet and topic modelling with what Regis has found. 

SVG Ideas: What kind of graphs do we want? Examples:
a graph that looks at stepmother figure and percentage of each attribute on `act` by the stepmother
as an agent and a receiver (two seperate graphs)

graphs for acts of all female characters, especially stepmothers/mothers, daughter/stepdaughters,
witches/sorceresses and queens. 

Marion presents us a sketch of a broader graph for all acts performed by female characters of
each `effect`attribute grouped together in one graph. See the sketch in our Slack channel.

Alexis will be our Queen of SVG and will start using X-Path to explore these ideas in our data
to start our visualizations.

Presentation: Team has set a Soft Draft due date for our project of next Thursday, 12/9 to
be ready for the presentations in class. Regis will present in class and Team will support if
questions come up about the particular tasks they performed. Team has set a complete date of
12/16 for the project, but hope to be done sooner.

It's the home stretch and everything will be ok...
