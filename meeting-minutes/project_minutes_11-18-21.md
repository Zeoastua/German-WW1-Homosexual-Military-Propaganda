# Project Meeting Minutes 11-18-2021

Updates from last week:

Regis needs to finish XML and fix a merge issue with his files in Git (successfully pushed
commits during meeting).

Victoria updated sources on About page on website; repo clean up started (minutes moved into
folder).

Alexis presents her favicon idea: Little Red Riding Hood is back! Her appearance needs to be 
tweaked a bit and is in progress. She also replaced straight quotes/apostrophes with curly ones
in the text. 

Question to Team: Do we want to keep lowercase styling of titles on website? Will revisit once
more text is added and we see them in relation to each other.

May need to review XML but additional editing discouraged if already complete.

We can acknowledge inconsistencies in the markup in the analysis due to the stories being marked
up by us as individuals. Could also add to bios who marked which story. 

## Next Big Step: XSLT and the Reading View:

XSLT is the second biggest thing we'll do on the project. Goal is to have a version of the 
reading view by next meeting, then we can begin to transform.

Option: modeled on Norse tales site: vertical bar of check boxes to add attributes to text in
reading view (both versions of stories remain together in browser.) Need to adjust HTML
to make this bar.

Reading view can focus on one aspect of analysis: ours will focus on the "hostile", "neutral"
and "benevolent" attributes of element action. 

Could possibly tie this in to concept of numbers system (like Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index)
used to classify folktales.

Analysis will be written after XSLT.

### For  next meeting:

Regis will finish German XML and make new XML files combining the German and Engish 
versions of the stories in one document (to transform with one XSLT). Will also make a 
seperate schema with a new root. 

Victoria will begin XSLT to turn into HTML once Regis is done.

Alexis will edit favicon and can help others as needed. She'll also continue working on 
analysis texts as our research takes shape. 

Darian will finish CSS changes, insert site-writing text into HTML and possibly make a scroll
bar for the reading view.

Can we have Little Red Riding Hood's head as our scroll box? Hmmm...possibly...
