# Meeting Minutes: 11/2/2021

with special guest, Dr. Birnbaum

## Meeting Change:

Team will now meet on Zoom on Thursday at 6:30pm, starting November 18. Next week, we'll meet
on Friday, November 12 at 8:30pm.

### Midterms:
Regis: Topic modeling is coming along. Can produce topics for German texts. Dr. Birnbaum advises
on strategy to remove stopwords in topic modeling. Now Regis needs English texts. Marion
advises getting unmarked text from previous version in our GitHub commit history. 

Alexis: Making progress on writings. Hopes to be completed within the week. Outline of 
prospective write-ups in text file on GitHub. Will send Slack message this week for 
everyone to provide her with biographical info for the Team block on the homepage by Friday.

Darian & Victoria:

Team likes the background. Victoria will adjust HTML to remove the table used to make the 
header bar, since it is not a good practice for layout. Better to use Grid. Helps make webpage
accessible for those with visual disabilities. Straight apostrophes in title should be
replaced with curly ones. We can use Schematron to control for. 
Darian will adjust CSS for these items: trying to match the color on the stone in the 
background for the menu-bar highlight (consult sites that can find numerical value of colors),
centering the title, enlarging the font. Team likes the font and could use multiple fonts
(but not too many) if desired. 
Index page has been loaded into the obdurodon server. As we update the HTML and CSS,
make sure to upload there as well with new changes. 

GitHub:
Make a file in the GitHub for sources, resources and references for citation for anything we
use on the website for publication. This includes our texts, graphics, borrowed code, etc.
We can answer the questions our classmates post on our issues every week.
Team needs to push and pull often to avoid merge issues. 
Write helpful and brief update commit messages.
Use the Projects tab!

Wisdom from Dr. Birnbaum: "There is no mistake you guys made I haven't made."

Team is doing great, is making good progress and IS ON TRACK.
