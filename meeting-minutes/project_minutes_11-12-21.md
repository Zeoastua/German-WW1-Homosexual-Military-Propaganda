# Project Meeting Minutes 11/12/21:

Reminder: Meeting on Thursday at 6:30pm going forward. Project tasks for the week are due by
then.

XSLT will be a big part of the rest of the project and now that midterms are in we are 
closer to being done and doing great!.

From midterms: Version of site is up and looks nice. Now we have to put all the writing from
Alexis' .txt files on the website. Can be copy/pasted in. Once text is in HTML, edit from 
HTML.
Site-writing file on GitHub should be considered closed. Darian volunteers to put the text 
into the HTML since she is adjusting CSS. Alexis and Darian will communicate in 
Slack when updating the text/HTML so they can coordinate.
CSS: Darian wants to add a scroll to the reading view boxes. Talk of translucent effect on 
site title header to make the black text easier to read. 
Darian will make CSS changes and send photos in Slack for Team to weigh in on
before making final decisions. 

Other tasks:
For next week: discuss as Team the reader view and come up with a plan for how we are going to
transform that XML into HTML and how we want it to function in our project. 
Find and replace straight apostrophes with curly ones. Alexis has volunteered to complete.
Victoria has volunteered to clean up the repo a bit.
Marion suggests a favicon for our site header. Team is bringing Little Red Riding Hood back!
Alexis will make and Victoria will add to HTML header when complete. 
Site needs a place for sources(texts, graphics, etc.) Team chose to list sources on About page.
Victoria will update HTML for second text box on that page to accommodate.

Topic Modeling (Regis):
Next step: look at other project that have used (Van Gogh, Milton, Inaugurations) from the 
course and see how they utilized and displayed.
Marion says we will probably use XSLT to translate into SVG, but we won't have to write it.
We have permission to use stylesheet from a project from last year. 
For next week: short write up on trends noticed. An outline is even acceptable.
Dr. B. wants Marion and Regis to meet with Evan to go over topic modeling in detail.
