# Project Meeting Minutes:

Tomorrow's Presentation:
Regis will lead our presentation. Team is asked to send what we want to make 
sure he talks about for the project in the Slack for 9am.

Updates:
Victoria: XSLT for Juniper Tree is done and XHTML for the reading view is loaded into the server.
The Cinderella combo XML has to be fixed to match the other combo XMLs to work 
with the XSLT after some tweaks.

Darian: Working on inserting the text-writing in to the site now. Asks if team
wants to see a scroll bar on the tales pages that compliments the color palatte.
Team wants to try it. Will add a `p` category to CSS to left align text on tale
pages. Continuing to experiement with the title text to make more readable.
Adding a lighter shadow to start. Will add categories to the CSS for the 
`@class` tags in the tales to format act effects for the reading view. 
Looking to pull colors from the background image: possibly green from the trees
for benevolent, the red from the leaves for hostile, and the stone/teal in the 
rocks for neutral. For presentation, will use placeholder colors. Will write up
explanation of above for corpus text box. 

Alexis: presents SVG draft. Wants to make a separate master key and a bar graph
for stepmother acts in both languages. Text for analysis page will come from 
graphs. Marion sends along instructions to insert SVG into HTML.

Regis: Topic modeling samples should be in for tomorrow. Plans to complete over
weekend. Will make SVG analysis. Needs reminder for uploading to the server. 

Team will meet Monday at 10am to work on the project and plan out the final 
details to be ready to submit by Friday, December 17.
