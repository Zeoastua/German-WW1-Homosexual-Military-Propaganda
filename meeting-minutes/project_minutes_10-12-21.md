We began with talking about the texts that Victoria discussed. People who can do english texts do the english texts and Regis will do the German texts.
Discussing who wants to be the xml person of the English texts. Regis discussed that it might be easiest to do the English Grimm tales html. 
We decided that we want to do an xml for each tale. We discussed doing the way translation changed between meaning and context. Marion noted that we could track those changes all in one document if we wanted to. Victoria asked if the gap between 1904 and 1912 is too big and if we want a smaller gap.
Regis believes it isn't too big of a gap, but Victoria noted that the 1904 version is for children so there would be a ton of adaptation and a complete change in audience.
Marion says we could use the one from 1904 that isn't a change of audience. We could use Ash Leeman's translations instead of the 1904 version. Regis and Victoria are inclined to using the Ash Leeman translations. The next question is what tales do we want to do?
Regis believes he is comfortable with whoever is doing the English version picking their number and Regis will do the German. Marion says we could tag everytime a character does an action or speaks and we could tag a connotation attribute. Regis says we could only tag female presenting characters to figure out the role of women in x tale. 
Marion says we could do connotations or describe what type of action is occuring. Marion says we could always pick more tales or we could eventually cut some out. Regis says we could make our lives easier by only doing tales that have a husband type character. We could look at father characters to see how they're presented differently in a 2002 translation.
Regis believes we could look at step mother and father and those translations. Alexis believes the step mother father idea is good. We discuss how the base of the project is how it changes with a different language over time. We will be using the 1812 original grimms text. Marion notes we could acknowledge the change between centuries and language. Regis says we could compare the wicked stepmother vs the good stepmother.
Victoria notes that we could throw mother mothers in there too. Regis agrees we'd be examining the role of mothers in a 200 year translation. We decide on examining mothers. We decide that starting with 10 stories might be a good idea. Alexis asks if we could begin picking out our 10 tales now. We decide Hansel and Gretal and Cinderella will be the first two. Rapunzel will be the third. Frau Holle will be the fourth. Little Snow White as the fifth. The Juniper Tree as the sixth. The Hare's Bride as the seventh. The Willful Child as the eigth. The Lazy Spinning Woman as the ninth. The Twelve Brothers as the tenth. We decide on doing the difference between mothers and women archetypes between a 2002 english version vs an 1812 original german text. Marion says the xml won't change if we do topic modeling. We need to ask ourselves what are we going to do in terms of markup. Marion says we should have a tentative schema done by our next meeting. She says we should make our schema before we start our markup. She says schema is asking ourself what we're going to markup and how they're going to relate to each other. We should set the basic rules that we want to follow. We want metadata for year and language. Schema should be very detailed. We decide to write notes for what our rules should be. Marion says she's going to write them down as notes.
For schema we want

1. Tales - root
1. Metadata, year, author, translator, language (required)
1. paragraphs (mixed-content), dialogue of women, actions of women, emotions of women, characters

We decide that Alexis will do the first four, Victoria will do the next three, and Darian will do the last three. Regis will do all of the German. Is everyone going to volunteer to write the preliminary schema is asked. We're supposed to make individual xml documents for each tale and get them into the repo. Marion suggests we should have one person work on the schema, and one person to put the texts into the repo. Victoria says that we have to change the name of our repo. Marion says she will text all of us on how to change the repo. Marion says we should update the readme to reflect some of the stuff that we talked about today and she wants Darian to do that. Marion says we should think about what our website should look like. General vibes.
