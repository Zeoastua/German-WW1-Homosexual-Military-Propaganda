The Willful Child
Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm
Once upon a time there was a child who was willful and did not do what his mother wanted. For this reason God was displeased with him and caused him to become ill, and no doctor could help him, and in a short time he lay on his deathbed.
He was lowered into a grave and covered with earth, but his little arm suddenly came forth and reached up, and it didn't help when they put it back in and put fresh earth over it, for the little arm always came out again. So the mother herself had to go to the grave and beat the little arm with a switch, and as soon as she had done that, it withdrew, and the child finally came to rest beneath the earth.

Although the Grimms' precise source is unknown, this tale, usually told as a local legend, is widely distributed throughout northern Germany. For more examples see The Hand from the Grave.
Translated by D. L. Ashliman. © 2000.
This tale, in a slightly different version, was introduced to the Grimms' collection in vol. 2 of the first edition (1815, no. 31). One small but significant change: The first edition states only that the child "became ill," not that "God ... caused him to become ill," as recorded in later editions.
I have arbitrarily assigned male gender to the child, whose sex cannot be determined by the German text.
Titles used by other translators: "The Stubborn Child," "The Wayward Child," "The Naughty Child."
