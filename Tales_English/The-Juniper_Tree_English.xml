        <p> Long ago, at least two thousand years, there was <act type="doing" agent="father"

            dearly. However, they had no children, though they wished very much to have some, and
                <act type="doing" agent="first_mother" effect="ambiguous"><character

                    woman</character> prayed for them</act> day and night, but they didn't get any,
            and they didn't get any.</p>
        <p>In front of their house there was a courtyard where there stood a juniper tree. One day
            in winter <character reference="first_mother" child-status="childless"
                marital-status="wife">the woman</character> was standing beneath it, peeling herself
            an apple, and while <act type="doing" agent="first_mother" effect="ambiguous">she was
                thus peeling the apple,</act>
            <act type="doing" agent="first_mother" effect="ambiguous">she cut her finger, and the
                blood fell into the snow.</act></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="first_mother" stateofbeing="negative">"Oh," said the woman.</dialogue>
            <act type="being" agent="first_mother" effect="hostile">She sighed heavily, looked at
                the blood before her, and was most unhappy.</act>
            <dialogue speaker="first_mother" stateofbeing="positive">"If only I had a child as red
                as blood and as white as snow."</dialogue> And as she said that, <act type="being"
                agent="first_mother" effect="benevolent">she became quite contented, and felt sure
                that it was going to happen.</act></p>
        <p>Then she went into the house, and a month went by, and the snow was gone. And two months,
            and everything was green. And three months, and all the flowers came out of the earth.
            And four months, and all the trees in the woods grew thicker, and the green branches
            were all entwined in one another, and the birds sang until the woods resounded and the
            blossoms fell from the trees. Then the fifth month passed, and <act type="doing"
                agent="first_mother" effect="ambiguous">she stood beneath the juniper tree,</act>
            which smelled so sweet that <act type="being" agent="first_mother" effect="benevolent"
                >her heart jumped for joy,</act> and <act type="doing" agent="first_mother"
                effect="benevolent">she fell on her knees and was beside herself.</act> And when the
            sixth month was over, the fruit was thick and large, and then <act type="doing"
                agent="first_mother" effect="benevolent">she was quite still.</act> And after the
            seventh month <act type="doing" agent="first_mother" effect="benevolent">she picked the
                juniper berries</act> and <act type="doing" agent="first_mother" effect="ambiguous"
                >ate them greedily.</act> Then <act type="being" agent="first_mother"
                effect="hostile">she grew sick and sorrowful.</act> Then the eighth month passed,
            and <act type="doing" agent="first_mother" receiver="father" effect="hostile">she called
                her husband to her, and cried,</act> and said, <dialogue speaker="first_mother"
                stateofbeing="negative">"If I die, then bury me beneath the juniper
                tree."</dialogue> Then <act type="being" agent="first_mother" effect="benevolent"
                >she was quite comforted and happy</act> until the next month was over, and <act

            later <act type="doing" agent="father" receiver="second_mother" effect="ambiguous">he
                took another wife.</act></p>

        <p>The goldsmith was sitting in his workshop making a golden chain, when he heard the bird
            sitting on his roof and singing. The song seemed very beautiful to him. He stood up, but
            as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers. However, he went right up the
            middle of the street with only one slipper and one sock on. He had his leather apron on,
            and in one hand he had a golden chain and in the other his tongs. The sun was shining

                beautifully you can sing. Sing that piece again for me."</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="boy" stateofbeing="neutral">"No," said the bird, "I do not sing twice
                for nothing. Give me the golden chain, and then I will sing it again for
                you."</dialogue> The goldsmith said, <dialogue stateofbeing="positive"
                speaker="goldsmith">"Here is the golden chain for you. Now sing that song again for
                me."</dialogue> Then the bird came and took the golden chain in his right claw, and
            went and sat in front of the goldsmith, and sang: <dialogue speaker="boy"
                stateofbeing="neutral"><act type="doing" agent="stepmother" receiver="boy"

        <p>Then the bird flew away to a shoemaker, and lit on his roof and sang: <dialogue
                speaker="boy" stateofbeing="neutral"><act type="doing" agent="stepmother"
                    receiver="boy" effect="hostile">My mother, she killed me,</act> My father, he

                I.</dialogue> Hearing this, the shoemaker ran out of doors in his shirtsleeves, and
            looked up at his roof, and had to hold his hand in front of his eyes to keep the sun
            from blinding him. <dialogue stateofbeing="positive" speaker="shoemaker">"Bird," said
                he, "how beautifully you can sing."</dialogue> Then he called in at his door,
                <dialogue stateofbeing="positive" speaker="shoemaker">"Wife, come outside. There is
                a bird here. Look at this bird. He certainly can sing."</dialogue> Then he called
            his daughter and her children, and the journeyman, and the apprentice, and the maid, and
            they all came out into the street and looked at the bird and saw how beautiful he was,
            and what fine red and green feathers he had, and how his neck was like pure gold, and
            how his eyes shone like stars in his head. <dialogue speaker="shoemaker"
                stateofbeing="positive">"Bird," said the shoemaker, "now sing that song again for
                me."</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="boy" stateofbeing="neutral">"No," said the bird, "I do not sing twice
                for nothing. You must give me something."</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="shoemaker" stateofbeing="positive">"Wife," said the man, "go into the
                shop. There is a pair of red shoes on the top shelf. Bring them down."</dialogue>
            Then the wife went and brought the shoes. "There, bird," said the man, "now sing that
            piece again for me." Then the bird came and took the shoes in his left claw, and flew
            back to the roof, and sang: <dialogue speaker="boy" stateofbeing="neutral"><act
                    type="doing" agent="stepmother" receiver="boy" effect="hostile">My mother, she
                    killed me,</act> My father, he ate me, <act type="doing" agent="marlene"

                tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.</dialogue></p>
        <p>When he had finished his song he flew away. In his right claw he had the chain and in his
            left one the shoes. He flew far away to a mill, and the mill went clickety-clack,
            clickety-clack, clickety-clack. In the mill sat twenty miller's apprentices cutting a
            stone, and chiseling chip-chop, chip-chop, chip-chop. And the mill went clickety-clack,
            clickety-clack, clickety-clack. Then the bird went and sat on a linden tree which stood
            in front of the mill, and sang: <dialogue stateofbeing="neutral" speaker="boy"><act
                    type="doing" agent="stepmother" receiver="boy" effect="hostile">My mother, she
                    killed me,</act></dialogue> Then one of them stopped working. My father, he ate
            me, Then two more stopped working and listened, <dialogue speaker="boy"
                stateofbeing="neutral"><character reference="marlene" marital-status="unmarried"
                    child-status="childless">My sister Marlene,</character></dialogue> Then four
            more stopped, <dialogue speaker="boy" stateofbeing="neutral"><act type="doing"
                    receiver="boy" agent="marlene" effect="benevolent">Gathered all my bones, Tied
                    them in a silken scarf,</act></dialogue> Now only eight only were chiseling,
                <dialogue stateofbeing="neutral" speaker="boy"><act type="doing" agent="marlene"
                    receiver="boy" effect="benevolent">Laid them beneath</act></dialogue> Now only
            five, the juniper tree, Now only one, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.</p>
        <p>Then the last one stopped also, and heard the last words. "Bird," said he, "how
            beautifully you sing. Let me hear that too. Sing it once more for me." "No," said the
            bird, "I do not sing twice for nothing. Give me the millstone, and then I will sing it
            again." "Yes," he said, "if it belonged only to me, you should have it." "Yes," said the
            others, "if he sings again he can have it." Then the bird came down, and the twenty
            millers took a beam and lifted the stone up. Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho! The
            bird stuck his neck through the hole and put the stone on as if it were a collar, then
            flew to the tree again, and sang: My mother, she killed me, My father, he ate me, My
            sister Marlene, Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, Laid them beneath
            the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.</p>
        <p>When he was finished singing, he spread his wings, and in his right claw he had the
            chain, and in his left one the shoes, and around his neck the millstone. He flew far
            away to his father's house. In the room the father, the mother, and Marlene were sitting
            at the table. The father said, "I feel so contented. I am so happy." "Not I," said the
            mother, "I feel uneasy, just as if a bad storm were coming." But Marlene just sat and
            cried and cried. Then the bird flew up, and as it seated itself on the roof, the father
            said, "Oh, I feel so truly happy, and the sun is shining so beautifully outside. I feel
            as if I were about to see some old acquaintance again." "Not I," said the woman, "I am
            so afraid that my teeth are chattering, and I feel like I have fire in my veins." And
            she tore open her bodice even more. Marlene sat in a corner crying. She held a
            handkerchief before her eyes and cried until it was wet clear through.</p>
        <p> Then the bird seated itself on the juniper tree, and sang: My mother, she killed me, The
            mother stopped her ears and shut her eyes, not wanting to see or hear, but there was a
            roaring in her ears like the fiercest storm, and her eyes burned and flashed like
            lightning. My father, he ate me, "Oh, mother," said the man, "that is a beautiful bird.
            He is singing so splendidly, and the sun is shining so warmly, and it smells like pure
            cinnamon." My sister Marlene, Then Marlene laid her head on her knees and cried and
            cried, but the man said, "I am going out. I must see the bird up close." "Oh, don't go,"
            said the woman, "I feel as if the whole house were shaking and on fire." But the man
            went out and looked at the bird. Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf,
            Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.</p>

        <p>With this the bird dropped the golden chain, and it fell right around the man's neck, so
            exactly around it that it fit beautifully. Then the man went in and said, "Just look
            what a beautiful bird that is, and what a beautiful golden chain he has given me, and
            how nice it looks." But the woman was terrified. She fell down on the floor in the room,
            and her cap fell off her head. Then the bird sang once more: My mother killed me. "I
            wish I were a thousand fathoms beneath the earth, so I would not have to hear that!" My
            father, he ate me, Then the woman fell down as if she were dead. My sister Marlene,
            "Oh," said Marlene, "I too will go out and see if the bird will give me something." Then
            she went out. Gathered all my bones, Tied them in a silken scarf, He threw the shoes
            down to her. Laid them beneath the juniper tree, Tweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am
            I. Then she was contented and happy. She put on the new red shoes and danced and leaped
            into the house. "Oh," she said, "I was so sad when I went out and now I am so contented.
            That is a splendid bird, he has given me a pair of red shoes." "No," said the woman,
            jumping to her feet and with her hair standing up like flames of fire, "I feel as if the
            world were coming to an end. I too, will go out and see if it makes me feel better." And
            as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it
            crushed her to death. The father and Marlene heard it and went out. Smoke, flames, and
            fire were rising from the place, and when that was over, the little brother was standing
            there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy,
            and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.</p>
