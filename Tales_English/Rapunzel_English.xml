        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="man and woman">Once upon a time there was a
                man and a <character child-status="mother" marital-status="wife" reference="wife"
                    >woman</character> who had long, but to no avail, wished for a child.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="benevolent" agent="wife">Finally the <character
                    reference="wife" marital-status="wife" child-status="mother">woman</character>
                came to believe that the good Lord would fulfill <character child-status="mother"
                    marital-status="wife" reference="wife">her</character> wish.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="man and woman">Through the small rear window
                of these people's house they could see into a splendid garden that was filled with
                the most beautiful flowers and herbs.</act>
            <act type="being" effect="ambiguous" agent="garden">The garden was surrounded by a high
                wall,</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="all">and no one dared enter,</act><act
                type="being" effect="hostile" agent="sorceress"> because it belonged to a sorceress
                who possessed great power and was feared by everyone.</act></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">One day the woman was standing at this
                window,</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">and she saw a bed planted with the
                most beautiful rapunzel.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">It looked so fresh and green that she
                longed for some.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">It was her greatest desire to eat some
                of the rapunzel.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">This desire increased with every
                day,</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife"/><act type="being" effect="hostile"
                agent="wife">and not knowing how to get any, she became miserably ill.</act></p>
        <p><act type="being" effect="hostile" agent="husband">Her husband was frightened, and asked
                her</act>, <dialogue speaker="husband" stateofbeing="neutral">"What ails you, dear
                wife?"</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="wife" stateofbeing="negative">"Oh,"</dialogue><act type="doing"
                effect="hostile" agent="wife">she answered,</act><dialogue speaker="wife"
                stateofbeing="negative">"if I do not get some rapunzel from the garden behind our
                house, I shall die."</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="husband">The man, who loved her dearly,
                thought,</act>
            <dialogue speaker="husband" stateofbeing="negative">"Before you let your <character
                    child-status="mother" marital-status="wife" reference="wife">wife</character>
                die, you must get her some of the rapunzel, whatever the cost."</dialogue></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="husband">So just as it was getting dark he
                climbed over the high wall into the <character child-status="childless"
                    reference="evil woman" marital-status="unmarried">sorceress's</character>
                garden, hastily dug up a handful of rapunzel, and took it to his <character
                    marital-status="wife" reference="wife" child-status="mother"
                >wife.</character></act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">She immediately made a salad from it,
                which she devoured eagerly.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">It tasted so very good to her that by
                the next day her desire for more had grown threefold.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">If she were to have any peace, the man
                would have to climb into the garden once again.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="husband">Thus he set forth once again just
                as it was getting dark. But no sooner than he had climbed over the wall than, to his
                horror, he saw the sorceress standing there before him.</act></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="evil woman" stateofbeing="negative">"How can you dare," <character
                    child-status="childless" reference="evil woman" marital-status="unmarried"
                    >she</character> asked with an angry look, "to climb into my garden and like a
                thief to steal my rapunzel? You will pay for this."</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="husband" stateofbeing="positive">"Oh," he answered, "Let mercy
                overrule justice. I came to do this out of necessity. My <character
                    marital-status="unmarried" reference="wife" child-status="mother"
                    >wife</character> saw your rapunzel from our window, and such a longing came
                over her, that she would die, if she did not get some to eat."</dialogue></p>
        <p><act type="being" effect="ambiguous" agent="evil woman">The sorceress's anger abated
                somewhat, and she said,</act>
            <dialogue speaker="evil woman" stateofbeing="negative">If things are as you say, I will
                allow you to take as much rapunzel as you want. But under one condition: You must
                give me the <character child-status="childless" marital-status="unmarried"
                    reference="Rapunzel">child</character> that your wife will bring to the world.
                It will do well, and I will take care of it like a mother."</dialogue></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="husband">In his fear the man agreed to
                everything.</act>
        </p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="wife" receiver="evil woman" io="Rapunzel">When
                the woman gave birth, the sorceress appeared, named the little girl Rapunzel, and
                took her away. Rapunzel became the most beautiful child under the sun.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="evil woman" receiver="Rapunzel">When she was
                twelve years old, the sorceress locked her in a tower that stood in a forest and
                that had neither a door nor a stairway, but only a tiny little window at the very
                top.</act></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="evil woman" io="Rapunzel">When the sorceress
                wanted to enter, she stood below and called out:</act></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="evil woman" stateofbeing="neutral">Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your
                hair to me.</dialogue></p>
        <p><act type="being" effect="benevolent" agent="Rapunzel">Rapunzel had splendid long hair,
                as fine as spun gold.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="Rapunzel" receiver="evil woman">When she
                heard the sorceress's voice, she untied her braids, wound them around a window hook,
                let her hair fall twenty yards to the ground, and the sorceress climbed up
            it.</act></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="prince">A few years later it happened that a
                king's son was riding through the forest.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="prince">As he approached the tower he heard
                a song so beautiful that he stopped to listen. It was Rapunzel, who was passing the
                time by singing with her sweet voice.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="prince">The prince wanted to climb up to
                her, and looked for a door in the tower, but none was to be found.</act></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="prince">He rode home, but the song had so
                touched his heart that he returned to the forest every day and listened to it.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="prince">One time, as he was thus standing
                behind a tree, he saw the sorceress approach, and heard her say:</act>
        </p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="evil woman" stateofbeing="neutral">Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your
                hair.</dialogue></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="benevolent" agent="Rapunzel" receiver="evil woman">Then
                Rapunzel let down her strands of hair, and the sorceress climbed up them to
                her.</act></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="prince" stateofbeing="positive">"If that is the ladder into the tower,
                then sometime I will try my luck."</dialogue></p>
        <p>And the next day, just as it was beginning to get dark, he went to the tower and called
            out:</p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="prince" stateofbeing="positive">Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your
                hair.</dialogue></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="benevolent" agent="prince" io="Rapunzel">The hair fell down,
                and the prince climbed up.</act></p>
        <p><act type="being" effect="hostile" agent="Rapunzel">At first Rapunzel was terribly
                frightened when a man such as she had never seen before came in to her.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="benevolent" agent="prince" receiver="Rapunzel">However, the
                prince began talking to her in a very friendly manner, telling her that his heart
                had been so touched by her singing that he could have no peace until he had seen her
                in person. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him
                as her husband,</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="Rapunzel"><character
                    child-status="childless" reference="Rapunzel" marital-status="unmarried"
                    >she</character> thought,</act>
            <dialogue speaker="Rapunzel" stateofbeing="neutral">He would rather have me than would
                old Frau Gothel."</dialogue>
            <act type="doing" receiver="prince" agent="Rapunzel" effect="benevolent">She said yes
                and placed her hand into his.</act></p>
        <p><act type="doing" agent="Rapunzel" effect="ambiguous">She said,</act>
            <dialogue speaker="Rapunzel" stateofbeing="positive">I would go with you gladly, but I
                do not know how to get down. Every time that you come, bring a strand of silk, from
                which I will weave a ladder. When it is finished I will climb down, and you can take
                me away on your horse."</dialogue>
            <act type="doing" effect="benevolent" agent="prince and Rapunzel">They arranged that he
                would come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day.</act></p>
        <p><act type="being" effect="ambiguous" agent="evil woman">The sorceress did not notice what
                was happening</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="Rapunzel" receiver="evil woman">until one
                day Rapunzel said to her,</act>
            <dialogue speaker="Rapunzel" stateofbeing="neutral">Frau Gothel, tell me why it is that
                you are more difficult to pull up than is the young prince, who will be arriving any
                moment now?"</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="evil woman" stateofbeing="negative">"You godless child," cried the
                sorceress. "What am I hearing from you? I thought I had removed you from the whole
                world, but you have deceived me nonetheless."</dialogue></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="evil woman" receiver="Rapunzel">In her anger
                she grabbed Rapunzel's beautiful hair, wrapped it a few times around her left hand,
                grasped a pair of scissors with her right hand, and snip snap, cut it off. And she
                was so unmerciful that she took Rapunzel into a wilderness where she suffered
                greatly.</act></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="evil woman" receiver="Rapunzel">On the evening
                of the same day that she sent Rapunzel away, the sorceress tied the cut-off hair to
                the hook at the top of the tower,</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="prince">and when the prince called
                out:</act></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="prince" stateofbeing="positive">Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your
                hair.</dialogue></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="evil woman">she let down the hair.</act></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="prince" io="evil woman">The prince climbed up,
                but above, instead of his beloved Rapunzel, he found the sorceress, who peered at
                him with poisonous and evil looks.</act></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="evil woman" stateofbeing="negative">"Aha!" she cried scornfully. "You
                have come for your Mistress Darling, but that beautiful bird is no longer sitting in
                her nest, nor is she singing any more. The cat got her, and will scratch your eyes
                out as well. You have lost Rapunzel. You will never see her again."</dialogue></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="prince">The prince was overcome with grief, and
                in his despair he threw himself from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the
                thorns into which he fell poked out his eyes. Blind, he wandered about in the
                forest, eating nothing but grass and roots, and doing nothing but weeping and
                wailing over the loss of his beloved wife.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="prince">Thus he wandered about miserably for
                some years, finally happening into the wilderness where Rapunzel lived miserably
                with the twins that she had given birth to.</act></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="prince">He heard a voice and thought it was
                familiar.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="benevolent" agent="prince and Rapunzel">He advanced toward it,
                and as he approached, Rapunzel recognized him, and crying, threw her arms around his
                neck. Two of her tears fell into his eyes, and they became clear once again, and he
                could see as well as before. He led her into his kingdom, where he was received with
                joy, and for a long time they lived happily and satisfied.</act></p>
