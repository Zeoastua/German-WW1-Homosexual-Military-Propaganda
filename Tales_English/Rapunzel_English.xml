                of these people's house they could see into a splendid garden that was filled with
                the most beautiful flowers and herbs.</act>
            <act type="being" effect="ambiguous" agent="garden">The garden was surrounded by a high
                wall,</act>

        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">One day the woman was standing at this

            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">and she saw a bed planted with the
                most beautiful rapunzel.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">It looked so fresh and green that she
                longed for some.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">It was her greatest desire to eat some
                of the rapunzel.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="wife">This desire increased with every

                effect="hostile" agent="wife">she answered,</act> "if I do not get some rapunzel
            from the garden behind our house, I shall die."</p>
        <p>The man, who loved her dearly, thought, "Before you let your wife die, you must get her
            some of the rapunzel, whatever the cost."</p>
        <p>So just as it was getting dark he climbed over the high wall into the sorceress's garden,
            hastily dug up a handful of rapunzel, and took it to his wife. She immediately made a
            salad from it, which she devoured eagerly. It tasted so very good to her that by the
            next day her desire for more had grown threefold. If she were to have any peace, the man
            would have to climb into the garden once again. Thus he set forth once again just as it
            was getting dark. But no sooner than he had climbed over the wall than, to his horror,
            he saw the sorceress standing there before him.</p>
        <p>"How can you dare," she asked with an angry look, "to climb into my garden and like a
            thief to steal my rapunzel? You will pay for this."</p>
        <p>"Oh," he answered, "Let mercy overrule justice. I came to do this out of necessity. My
            wife saw your rapunzel from our window, and such a longing came over her, that she would
            die, if she did not get some to eat."</p>
        <p>The sorceress's anger abated somewhat, and she said, "If things are as you say, I will
            allow you to take as much rapunzel as you want. But under one condition: You must give
            me the child that your wife will bring to the world. It will do well, and I will take
            care of it like a mother."</p>
        <p>In his fear the man agreed to everything.</p>
        <p>When the woman gave birth, the sorceress appeared, named the little girl Rapunzel, and
            took her away. Rapunzel became the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was
            twelve years old, the sorceress locked her in a tower that stood in a forest and that
            had neither a door nor a stairway, but only a tiny little window at the very top.</p>
        <p>When the sorceress wanted to enter, she stood below and called out:</p>
        <p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair to me.</p>
        <p>Rapunzel had splendid long hair, as fine as spun gold. When she heard the sorceress's
            voice, she untied her braids, wound them around a window hook, let her hair fall twenty
            yards to the ground, and the sorceress climbed up it.</p>
        <p>A few years later it happened that a king's son was riding through the forest. As he
            approached the tower he heard a song so beautiful that he stopped to listen. It was
            Rapunzel, who was passing the time by singing with her sweet voice. The prince wanted to
            climb up to her, and looked for a door in the tower, but none was to be found.</p>
        <p>He rode home, but the song had so touched his heart that he returned to the forest every
            day and listened to it. One time, as he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw the
            sorceress approach, and heard her say:</p>
        <p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair.</p>
        <p>Then Rapunzel let down her strands of hair, and the sorceress climbed up them to her.</p>
        <p>"If that is the ladder into the tower, then sometime I will try my luck."</p>
        <p>And the next day, just as it was beginning to get dark, he went to the tower and called
            out:</p>
        <p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair.</p>
        <p>The hair fell down, and the prince climbed up.</p>
        <p>At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man such as she had never seen before
            came in to her. However, the prince began talking to her in a very friendly manner,
            telling her that his heart had been so touched by her singing that he could have no
            peace until he had seen her in person. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked
            her if she would take him as her husband, she thought, "He would rather have me than
            would old Frau Gothel." She said yes and placed her hand into his.</p>
        <p>She said, "I would go with you gladly, but I do not know how to get down. Every time that
            you come, bring a strand of silk, from which I will weave a ladder. When it is finished
            I will climb down, and you can take me away on your horse." They arranged that he would
            come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day.</p>
        <p>The sorceress did not notice what was happening until one day Rapunzel said to her, "Frau
            Gothel, tell me why it is that you are more difficult to pull up than is the young
            prince, who will be arriving any moment now?"</p>
        <p>"You godless child," cried the sorceress. "What am I hearing from you? I thought I had
            removed you from the whole world, but you have deceived me nonetheless."</p>
        <p>In her anger she grabbed Rapunzel's beautiful hair, wrapped it a few times around her
            left hand, grasped a pair of scissors with her right hand, and snip snap, cut it off.
            And she was so unmerciful that she took Rapunzel into a wilderness where she suffered
            greatly.</p>
        <p>On the evening of the same day that she sent Rapunzel away, the sorceress tied the
            cut-off hair to the hook at the top of the tower, and when the prince called out:</p>
        <p>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair.</p>
        <p>she let down the hair.</p>
        <p>The prince climbed up, but above, instead of his beloved Rapunzel, he found the
            sorceress, who peered at him with poisonous and evil looks.</p>
        <p>"Aha!" she cried scornfully. "You have come for your Mistress Darling, but that beautiful
            bird is no longer sitting in her nest, nor is she singing any more. The cat got her, and
            will scratch your eyes out as well. You have lost Rapunzel. You will never see her
            again."</p>
        <p>The prince was overcome with grief, and in his despair he threw himself from the tower.
            He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell poked out his eyes. Blind,
            he wandered about in the forest, eating nothing but grass and roots, and doing nothing
            but weeping and wailing over the loss of his beloved wife. Thus he wandered about
            miserably for some years, finally happening into the wilderness where Rapunzel lived
            miserably with the twins that she had given birth to.</p>
        <p>He heard a voice and thought it was familiar. He advanced toward it, and as he
            approached, Rapunzel recognized him, and crying, threw her arms around his neck. Two of
            her tears fell into his eyes, and they became clear once again, and he could see as well
            as before. He led her into his kingdom, where he was received with joy, and for a long
            time they lived happily and satisfied.</p>
