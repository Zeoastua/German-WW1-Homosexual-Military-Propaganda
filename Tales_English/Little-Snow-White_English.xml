                effect="hostile">she looked at Snow-White her heart turned over inside her

        <p>Then<act type="doing" agent="second_queen" receiver="huntsman" effect="ambiguous">she
                summoned a huntsman</act>and said to him,<dialogue speaker="second_queen"

            <act type="doing" agent="huntsman" receiver="snow_white" effect="hostile">The huntsman

                receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent">the huntsman took pity on her,</act> and
            he said,<dialogue speaker="huntsman" stateofbeing="positive">"Run away, you poor

                >"The wild animals will soon devour you anyway,"</dialogue> but still it was as if a
            stone had fallen from his heart, for he would not have to kill her. Just then a young
            boar came running by. He killed it, cut out its lungs and liver, and <act type="doing"
                agent="huntsman" receiver="second_queen" effect="hostile" io="boar_organs">took them
                back to the queen as proof of Snow-White's death.</act> The cook had to boil them
            with salt, and <act type="doing" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white"
                effect="hostile" io="boar_organs">the wicked woman ate them, supposing that she had
                eaten Snow-White's lungs and liver.</act></p>

        <p>The <character marital-status="unmarried" child-status="childless" reference="snow_white"
                >poor child</character> was now all alone in the great forest, and <act type="being"
                agent="snow_white" receiver="self" effect="hostile">she was so afraid that she just
                looked at all the leaves on the trees and did not know what to do.</act>Then <act
                type="doing" agent="snow_white" effect="ambiguous">she began to run.</act> She ran
            over sharp stones and through thorns, and<act type="doing" agent="snow_white"
                effect="benevolent">wild animals jumped at her, but they did her no harm.</act>
            <act type="doing" agent="snow_white" effect="ambiguous">She ran as far as her feet could
                carry her,</act> and just as evening was about to fall <act type="doing"
                agent="snow_white" effect="benevolent">she saw a little house and went inside</act>
            in order to rest. Inside the house everything was small, but so neat and clean that no
            one could say otherwise. There was a little table with a white tablecloth and seven
            little plates, and each plate had a spoon, and there were seven knives and forks and
            seven mugs as well. Against the wall there were seven little beds, all standing in a row
            and covered with snow-white sheets. Because <act type="being" agent="snow_white"
                effect="ambiguous">she was so hungry and thirsty</act>
            <act type="doing" agent="snow_white" effect="ambiguous">Snow-White ate a few vegetables
                and a little bread from each little plate,</act> and <act type="doing"
                agent="snow_white" effect="ambiguous">from each mug she drank a drop of wine.</act>
            Afterward, because <act type="being" agent="snow_white" effect="ambiguous">she was so
                tired,</act>
            <act type="doing" agent="snow_white" effect="ambiguous">she lay down on a bed,</act> but
            none of them felt right -- one was too long, the other too short -- until finally the
            seventh one was just right. <act type="doing" agent="snow_white" effect="benevolent">She
                remained lying in it, entrusted herself to God, and fell asleep.</act></p>

        <p>After dark the masters of the house returned home. They were the seven dwarfs who picked
            and dug for ore in the mountains. They lit their seven candles, and as soon as it was
            light in their house they saw that someone had been there, for not everything was in the
            same order as they had left it. The first one said,<dialogue speaker="first_dwarf"
                stateofbeing="neutral">"Who has been sitting in my chair?"</dialogue> The second
                one,<dialogue speaker="second_dwarf" stateofbeing="neutral">"Who has been eating
                from my plate?"</dialogue>The third one,<dialogue speaker="third_dwarf"
                stateofbeing="neutral">"Who has been eating my bread?"</dialogue>The fourth
                one,<dialogue speaker="fourth_dwarf" stateofbeing="neutral">"Who has been eating my
                vegetables?"</dialogue>The fifth one,<dialogue speaker="fifth_dwarf"
                stateofbeing="neutral">"Who has been sticking with my fork?"</dialogue>The sixth
                one,<dialogue speaker="sixth_dwarf" stateofbeing="neutral">"Who has been cutting
                with my knife?"</dialogue>The seventh one,<dialogue speaker="seventh_dwarf"
                stateofbeing="neutral">"Who has been drinking from my mug?"</dialogue>Then the first
            one saw a that there was a little imprint in his bed, and said,<dialogue
                speaker="first_dwarf" stateofbeing="neutral">"Who stepped on my bed?"</dialogue>The
            others came running up and shouted,<dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="neutral"
                >"Someone has been lying in mine as well."</dialogue>But the seventh one, looking at
            his bed, <act type="doing" agent="dwarf" receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent">found
                Snow-White lying there asleep.</act> The seven dwarfs all came running up, and they
            cried out with amazement. They fetched their seven candles and shone the light on
                <character marital-status="unmarried" child-status="childless"
                reference="snow_white">Snow-White</character>.<dialogue speaker="dwarves"
                stateofbeing="positive">"Oh good heaven! Oh good heaven!"</dialogue>they
                cried.<dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="positive">"This child is so
                beautiful!"</dialogue>They were so happy, that <act type="doing" agent="dwarves"
                receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent">they did not wake her up,</act> but <act
                type="doing" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent">let her
                continue to sleep</act> there in the bed. The seventh dwarf had to sleep with his
            companions, one hour with each one, and then the night was done.</p>

        <p>The next morning <act type="doing" agent="snow_white" effect="benevolent">Snow-White woke
                up</act>, and when <act type="doing" agent="snow_white" receiver="dwarves"
                effect="benevolent">she saw the seven dwarfs</act>
            <act type="being" agent="snow_white" effect="hostile">she was frightened.</act> But they
            were friendly and asked,<dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="neutral"> "What is
                your name?"</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="neutral">"My name is Snow-White,"
            </dialogue>she answered. <dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="neutral">"How did you
                find your way to our house?"</dialogue>the dwarfs asked further. Then <act
                type="doing" agent="snow_white" receiver="dwarves" effect="ambiguous">she told
                them</act> that <act type="doing" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white"
                effect="hostile">her stepmother had tried to kill her,</act><act type="doing"
                agent="huntsman" receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent">that the huntsman had
                spared her life, </act>and that <act type="doing" agent="snow_white"
                effect="ambiguous">she had run the entire day, finally coming to their house.</act>
            The dwarfs said,<dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="positive"> "If you will keep
                house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean
                and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you
                want." </dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="positive">"Yes," said Snow-White, "with all
                my heart."</dialogue>So <act type="doing" agent="snow_white" receiver="dwarves"
                effect="benevolent">she kept house for them.</act> Every morning they went into the
            mountains looking for ore and gold, and in the evening when they came back home their
            meal had to be ready. During the day <act type="being" agent="snow_white"
                receiver="self" effect="ambiguous">the girl was alone.</act> The good dwarfs warned
            her, saying, <dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="negative">"Be careful about your
                    <character marital-status="wife" child-status="stepmother"
                    reference="second_queen">stepmother.</character>
                <act type="being" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white" effect="hostile">She
                    will soon know that you are here.</act> Do not let anyone in."</dialogue></p>

        <p>Now the queen, believing that <act type="doing" agent="second_queen"
                receiver="snow_white" effect="hostile" io="boar_organs">she had eaten Snow-White 's
                lungs and liver,</act> could only think that <act type="being" agent="second_queen"
                receiver="self" effect="ambiguous">she was again the first and the most beautiful
                woman of all.</act> She stepped before her mirror and said:<dialogue
                speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="neutral">Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who in
                this land is fairest of all?</dialogue>It answered:<dialogue speaker="mirror"
                stateofbeing="negative">You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But <character
                    reference="snow_white" child-status="childless" marital-status="unmarried"
                    >Snow-White,</character> beyond the mountains With the seven dwarfs, Is still a
                thousand times fairer than you.</dialogue> This startled the queen, for she knew
            that the mirror did not lie, and she realized that<act type="doing" agent="huntsman"
                receiver="second_queen" effect="hostile">the huntsman had deceived her,</act> and
            that Snow-White was still alive. Then she thought, and thought again, <act type="doing"
                agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white" effect="hostile">how she could kill
                Snow-White,</act> for as long as long as she was not the most beautiful woman in the
            entire land <act type="being" agent="second_queen" receiver="self" effect="hostile">her
                envy would give her no rest.</act></p>

        <p>At last she thought of something. Coloring her face,<act type="doing"
                agent="second_queen" receiver="self" effect="hostile">she disguised herself as an
                    <character marital-status="wife" child-status="stepmother"
                    reference="second_queen">old peddler woman</character>,</act>so that no one
            would recognize her. In this disguise she went to the house of the seven dwarfs.
            Knocking on the door she called out,<dialogue speaker="second_queen"
                stateofbeing="negative">"Beautiful wares for sale, for sale!"</dialogue>Snow-White
            peered out the window and said,<dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="positive"
                >"Good day, dear woman, what do you have for sale?"</dialogue><dialogue
                speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="neutral">"Good wares, beautiful wares," she
                answered. "Bodice laces in all colors."</dialogue>And she took out one that was
            braided from colorful silk.<dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="neutral"
                >"Would you like this one?"</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="positive">"I can let that honest woman in,"
                thought Snow-White,</dialogue>then unbolted the door and <act type="doing"
                agent="snow_white" receiver="second_queen" effect="hostile">bought the pretty bodice
                lace.</act><dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="negative">"Child," said
                the old woman, "how you look! Come, let me lace you up properly."</dialogue>The
            unsuspecting Snow-White stood before her and <act type="doing" agent="second_queen"
                receiver="snow_white" effect="hostile">let her do up the new lace, but the old woman
                pulled so quickly and so hard that Snow-White could not breathe.</act>
            <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="negative">"You used to be the most
                beautiful one," said the old woman,</dialogue>and hurried away.</p>

        <p>Not long afterward, in the evening time, the seven dwarfs came home. How terrified they
            were when they saw their dear<act type="being" agent="snow_white" receiver="self"
                effect="hostile">Snow-White lying on the ground, not moving at all, as though she
                were dead.</act> They lifted her up, and, <act type="doing" agent="dwarves"
                receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent">seeing that she was too tightly laced,
                they cut the lace in two.</act> Then she began to breathe a little, and little by
            little <act type="doing" agent="snow_white" receiver="self" effect="benevolent">she came
                back to life.</act>When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, <dialogue
                speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="negative">"The <character marital-status="wife"
                    child-status="stepmother" reference="second_queen">old peddler woman</character>
                was no one else but the godless <character reference="second_queen"
                    child-status="stepmother" marital-status="wife">queen.</character> Take care and
                let no one in when we are not with you."</dialogue></p>

        <p>When the wicked woman returned home she went to her mirror and asked: <dialogue
                speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="positive">Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who in
                this land is fairest of all?</dialogue> The mirror answered once again: <dialogue
                speaker="mirror" stateofbeing="negative">You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But
                Snow-White, beyond the mountains With the seven dwarfs, Is still a thousand times
                fairer than you.</dialogue> When she heard that, all her blood ran to her heart
            because she knew that<act type="doing" agent="snow_white" receiver="self"
                effect="hostile"> Snow-White had come back to life.</act>
            <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="negative">"This time," she said, "I shall
                think of something that will destroy you."</dialogue></p>

        <p><act type="doing" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white" effect="hostile">Then with
                the art of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisoned comb.</act> Then
            she disguised herself, <act type="doing" agent="second_queen" receiver="self"
                effect="hostile">taking the form of a different <character marital-status="wife"
                    child-status="stepmother" reference="second_queen">old woman.</character></act>
            Thus she went across the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked on the door, and
            called out, <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="neutral">"Good wares for
                sale, for sale!"</dialogue> Snow-White looked out and said, <dialogue
                speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="negative">"Go on your way. I am not allowed to
                let anyone in."</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="negative">"You surely may take a
                look,"</dialogue> said the old woman, pulling out the poisoned comb and holding it
            up. The child liked it so much that she <act type="doing" agent="second_queen"
                receiver="snow_white" effect="hostile">let herself be deceived, and she opened the
                door.</act> After they had agreed on the purchase, the old woman said, <dialogue
                speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="negative">"Now let me comb your hair
                properly."</dialogue> She had barely <act type="doing" agent="second_queen"
                receiver="snow_white" effect="hostile">stuck the comb into Snow-White's hair when
                the poison took effect, and the girl fell down unconscious.</act>
            <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="negative">"You specimen of beauty," said
                the wicked woman, "now you are finished."</dialogue> And she walked away.</p>

        <p>Fortunately it was almost evening, and the seven dwarfs came home. When they saw <act
                type="doing" agent="second_queen" effect="hostile" receiver="snow_white"><character
                    marital-status="unmarried" child-status="childless" reference="snow_white"
                    >Snow-White</character> lying on the ground as if she were dead,</act> they
            immediately suspected her stepmother. They <act type="doing" agent="dwarves"
                receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent">examined her and found the poisoned
                comb.</act> They had scarcely pulled it out when Snow-White came to herself again
            and told them what had happened. Once again they warned her to be on guard and not to
            open the door for anyone.</p>

        <p>Back at home the queen stepped before her mirror and said: <dialogue
                speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="positive">Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who in
                this land is fairest of all?</dialogue> The mirror answered: <dialogue
                speaker="mirror" stateofbeing="negative">You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But
                Snow-White, beyond the mountains With the seven dwarfs, Is still a thousand times
                fairer than you.</dialogue> When the queen heard the mirror saying this, she shook
            and trembled with anger, <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="negative"
                >"Snow-White shall die," she shouted, "if it costs me my life!"</dialogue></p>

        <p><act type="doing" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white" effect="hostile">Then she
                went into her most secret room -- no one else was allowed inside -- and she made a
                poisoned, poisoned apple.</act> From the outside it was beautiful, white with red
            cheeks, and anyone who saw it would want it. But anyone who might eat a little piece of
            it would died. Then, coloring her face, <act type="doing" agent="second_queen"
                receiver="self" effect="hostile">she disguised herself as a <character
                    marital-status="wife" child-status="stepmother" reference="second_queen">peasant
                    woman</character>,</act> and thus went across the seven mountains to the seven
            dwarfs. She knocked on the door. Snow-White stuck her head out the window and said,
                <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="negative">"I am not allowed to let
                anyone in. The dwarfs have forbidden me to do so."</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="positive">"That is all right with me,"
                answered the peasant woman. "I'll easily get rid of my apples. Here, I'll give you
                one of them."</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="negative">"No," said Snow-White, "I cannot
                accept anything."</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="negative">"Are you afraid of poison?"
                asked the old woman. "Look, I'll cut the apple in two. You eat the red half, and I
                shall eat the white half."</dialogue> Now the apple had been so artfully made that
            only the red half was poisoned. Snow-White longed for the beautiful apple, and when she
            saw that the peasant woman was eating part of it she could no longer resist, and she
            stuck her hand out and took the poisoned half. She barely had a bite in her mouth when
                <act type="doing" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white" effect="hostile">she
                fell to the ground dead.</act> The queen <act type="doing" agent="second_queen"
                receiver="snow_white" effect="hostile">looked at her with a gruesome stare, laughed
                loudly,</act> and said, <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="negative"
                >"White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony wood! This time the dwarfs cannot
                awaken you."</dialogue></p>

        <p>Back at home she asked her mirror: <dialogue speaker="second_queen"
                stateofbeing="positive">Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who in this land is fairest of
                all?</dialogue> It finally answered: <dialogue speaker="mirror"
                stateofbeing="positive">You, my queen, are fairest of all.</dialogue> Then her
            envious heart was at rest, as well as an envious heart can be at rest.</p>

        <p>When the dwarfs came home that evening they found Snow-White lying on the ground. She was
            not breathing at all. <act type="being" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white"
                effect="hostile">She was dead. </act>
            <act type="doing" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent">They lifted
                her up and looked for something poisonous.</act>
            <act type="doing" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent">They undid
                her laces.</act>
            <act type="doing" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent"> They combed
                her hair.</act>
            <act type="doing" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent">They washed
                her with water and wine.</act> But nothing helped. The dear child was dead, and she
            remained dead. They <act type="doing" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white"
                effect="benevolent">laid her on a bier,</act> and all seven sat next to her and <act
                type="doing" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent"> mourned for
                her and cried</act> for three days. They were going to bury her, but she still
            looked as fresh as a living person, and still had her beautiful red cheeks. They said,
                <dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="negative">"We cannot bury her in the black
                earth,"</dialogue> and <act type="doing" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white"
                effect="benevolent">they had a transparent glass coffin made,</act> so she could be
            seen from all sides. They <act type="doing" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white"
                effect="benevolent">laid her inside, and with golden letters wrote on it her
                name,</act> and that she was a princess. Then they put the coffin outside on a
            mountain, and <act type="doing" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white"
                effect="benevolent">one of them always stayed with it and watched over her.</act>
            The animals too came and mourned for Snow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and finally
            a dove. Snow-White lay there in the coffin a long, long time, and <act type="doing"
                agent="snow_white" receiver="self" effect="benevolent">she did not decay, but looked
                like she was asleep,</act> for she was still as white as snow and as red as blood,
            and as black-haired as ebony wood.</p>

        <p>Now it came to pass that a prince entered these woods and happened onto the dwarfs'
            house, where he sought shelter for the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain with
            beautiful Snow-White in it, and he read what was written on it with golden letters. Then
            he said to the dwarfs, <dialogue speaker="prince" stateofbeing="positive">"Let me have
                the coffin. I will give you anything you want for it."</dialogue> But the dwarfs
                answered,<dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="negative">"We will not sell it
                for all the gold in the world."</dialogue> Then he said, <dialogue speaker="prince"
                stateofbeing="positive">"Then give it to me, for I cannot live without being able to
                see Snow-White. I will honor her and respect her as my most cherished
                one."</dialogue>As he thus spoke, the good dwarfs felt pity for him and gave him the
            coffin. The prince had his servants carry it away on their shoulders. But then it
            happened that one of them stumbled on some brush, and this <act type="doing"
                agent="servents" receiver="snow_white" effect="benevolent">dislodged from
                Snow-White's throat the piece of poisoned apple</act> that she had bitten off. Not
            long afterward <act type="doing" agent="snow_white" receiver="self" effect="benevolent"
                >she opened her eyes, lifted the lid from her coffin, sat up, and was alive
                again.</act>
            <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="positive">"Good heavens, where am
                I?"</dialogue> she cried out. The prince said joyfully, <dialogue speaker="prince"
                stateofbeing="positive">"You are with me."</dialogue> He told her what had happened,
            and then said, <dialogue speaker="prince" stateofbeing="positive"> "I love you more than
                anything else in the world. Come with me to my father's castle. You shall become my
                wife."</dialogue><act type="being" agent="snow_white" receiver="self"
                effect="benevolent">Snow White loved him,</act> and she went with him. Their wedding
            was planned with great splendor and majesty.</p>

            invited to the feast. After putting on her beautiful clothes she stepped before her
            mirror and said: <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="positive">Mirror,
                mirror, on the wall, Who in this land is fairest of all?</dialogue> The mirror
            answered: <dialogue speaker="mirror" stateofbeing="negative">You, my queen, are fair; it
                is true. But the young queen is a thousand times fairer than you.</dialogue> The

                effect="hostile">she became so frightened, so frightened, that she did not know what

            She had to go and see the young queen. When she arrived she recognized Snow-White, and
            terrorized, she could only stand there without moving. Then <act type="doing"
