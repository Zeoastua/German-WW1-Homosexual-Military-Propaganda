    <story>
        <p>Once upon a time in midwinter, when the snowflakes were falling like feathers from
            heaven, a<character marital-status="wife">queen</character> sat sewing at her window,
            which had a frame of black ebony wood. As she sewed she looked up at the snow and
                <action type="negative" agent="self" receiver="self">pricked</action> her finger
            with her needle. Three drops of blood fell into the snow. The red on the white looked so
            beautiful that she thought to herself, <dialogue speaker="first_queen"
                stateofbeing="wishful">"If only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood,and
                as black as the wood in this frame."</dialogue>Soon afterward she had a little
            daughter who was as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony wood, and
            therefore they called her <character>Little Snow-White</character>. And as soon as the
            child was<action type="positive" agent="first_queen" receiver="snow_white"
            >born</action>, the <character child-status="mother" marital-status="wife"
                >queen</character>
            <action type="negative" agent="self" receiver="self">died</action>.</p>

        <p>A year later the<character>king</character><action type="positive" agent="king"
                receiver="second_queen">took</action>himself another<character
                child-status="stepmother" marital-status="wife">wife</character>. She was a
            beautiful woman, but she was proud and arrogant, and she could not stand it if anyone
            might surpass her in beauty. She had a <character>magic mirror</character>. Every
            morning she stood before it, looked at herself, and said: <dialogue
                speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="vain">Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who in this
                land is fairest of all?</dialogue>To this the <character>mirror</character>
                answered:<dialogue speaker="mirror" stateofbeing="fawning">You, my queen, are
                fairest of all.</dialogue>Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the mirror spoke
            the truth.</p>

        <p><character>Snow-White</character>grew up and became ever more beautiful. When she was
            seven years old she was as beautiful as the light of day, even more beautiful than
                the<character child-status="stepmother">queen</character>herself. One day when the
            queen asked her mirror:<dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="vain">Mirror,
                mirror, on the wall, Who in this land is fairest of all?</dialogue>It
                answered:<dialogue speaker="mirror" stateofbeing="informative">You, my queen, are
                fair; it is true. But Snow-White is a thousand times fairer than you.</dialogue>The
                queen<action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="self">took
                fright</action>and turned yellow and green with envy. From that hour on whenever
                <action type="neutral" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white">she looked at
                Snow-White</action>her heart turned over inside her body, so great was her hatred
            for the girl. The<action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="self">envy and
                pride grew ever greater</action>, like a weed in her heart, until she had no peace
            day and night.</p>

        <p>Then she <action type="neutral" agent="second_queen" receiver="huntsman"
                >summoned</action>a huntsman and said to him,<dialogue speaker="second_queen"
                stateofbeing="murderous"> "Take Snow-White out into the woods. I never want to see
                her again. Kill her, and as proof that she is dead bring her lungs and her liver
                back to me."</dialogue> Thehuntsman<action type="negative" agent="huntsman"
                receiver="snow_white">obeyed and took Snow-White into the woods.</action> He<action
                type="negatvie" agent="huntsman" receiver="snow_white">took out his hunting knife
                and was about to stab</action>it into her innocent heart<action type="negative"
                agent="snow_white" receiver="self">when she began to cry,</action>saying,<dialogue
                speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="desperate">"Oh, dear huntsman, let me live. I
                will run into the wild woods and never come back."</dialogue>Because she was so
            beautiful the<character>huntsman</character><action type="positive" agent="huntsman"
                receiver="snow_white">took pity</action>on her, and he said, <dialogue
                speaker="huntsman" stateofbeing="helpful">"Run away, you poor child."</dialogue>He
            thought, "The wild animals will soon devour you anyway," but still it was as if a stone
            had fallen from his heart, for he would not have to kill her. Just then a young boar
            came running by. He killed it, cut out its lungs and liver, and took them back to the
            queen as proof of Snow-White's death. The cook had to boil them with salt, and the
            wicked woman ate them, supposing that she had eaten Snow-White's lungs and liver.</p>
<!-- I'm not sure what to mark up on the paragraph below -->
        <p>The poor child was now all alone in the great forest, and she was so afraid that she just
            looked at all the leaves on the trees and did not know what to do. Then she began to
            run. She ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and wild animals jumped at her, but
            they did her no harm. She ran as far as her feet could carry her, and just as evening
            was about to fall she saw a little house and went inside in order to rest.Inside the
            house everything was small, but so neat and clean that no one could say otherwise. There
            was a little table with a white tablecloth and seven little plates, and each plate had a
            spoon, and there were seven knives and forks and seven mugs as well. Against the wall
            there were seven little beds, all standing in a row and covered with snow-white
            sheets.Because she was so hungry and thirsty <character>Snow-White</character> ate a few
            vegetables and a little bread from each little plate, and from each mug she drank a drop
            of wine. Afterward, because she was so tired, she lay down on a bed, but none of them
            felt right -- one was too long, the other too short -- until finally the seventh one was
            just right. She remained lying in it, entrusted herself to God, and fell asleep.</p>

        <p>After dark the masters of the house returned home. They were<character>the seven
                dwarfs</character> who picked and dug for ore in the mountains. They lit their seven
            candles, and as soon as it was light in their house they saw that someone had been
            there, for not everything was in the same order as they had left it. The first
                one said,<dialogue speaker="first_dwarf" stateofbeing="confused">"Who
                has been sitting in my chair?"</dialogue> The second
                one,<dialogue speaker="second_dwarf" stateofbeing="confused">"Who has
                been eating from my plate?"</dialogue> The third
                one,<dialogue speaker="third_dwarf" stateofbeing="confused">"Who has
                been eating my bread?"</dialogue>The fourth one,<dialogue
                speaker="fourth_dwarf" stateofbeing="confused">"Who has been eating my
                vegetables?"</dialogue>The fifth one,<dialogue
                speaker="fifth_dwarf" stateofbeing="confused">"Who has been sticking with my
                fork?"</dialogue>The sixth one,<dialogue speaker="sixth_dwarf"
                stateofbeing="confused">"Who has been cutting with my knife?"</dialogue>
                The seventh one,<dialogue speaker="seventh_dwarf"
                stateofbeing="confused">"Who has been drinking from my mug?"</dialogue>Then
                the first one saw a that there was a little imprint in his
            bed, and said,<dialogue speaker="first_dwarf" stateofbeing="confused">"Who stepped on
                my bed?"</dialogue>The others came running up and
                shouted,<dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="confused">"Someone has been lying
                in mine as well."</dialogue>But the seventh one, looking at
            his bed, found Snow-White lying there asleep. The seven dwarfs all
            came running up, and they cried out with amazement. They fetched their seven candles and
            shone the light on Snow-White.<dialogue speaker="dwarves"
                stateofbeing="excited">"Oh good heaven! Oh good heaven!"</dialogue>they cried.
                <dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="happy">"This child is so
                beautiful!"</dialogue>They were so happy, that they did not wake her up, but let her
            continue to sleep there in the bed. The seventh dwarf had to sleep with his companions,
            one hour with each one, and then the night was done.</p>

        <p>The next morning Snow-White woke up, and when she saw the seven dwarfs she was
            frightened. But they were friendly and asked,<dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="helpful"> "What is your name?"</dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="afraid">"My name is Snow-White," </dialogue>she answered. 
            <dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="helpful">"How did you find your way to our house?"</dialogue>the dwarfs asked
            further. Then she told them that<action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white">her stepmother had tried to kill her,</action>that 
            the huntsman<action type="positive" agent="huntsman" receiver="snow_white">had spared her life, </action>and that she had run the entire day, finally coming to their house.
            The dwarfs said,<dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="helpful"> "If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and
            knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall
            have everything that you want." </dialogue>
            <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="grateful">"Yes," said Snow-White, "with all my heart."</dialogue>So she kept
            house for them. Every morning they went into the mountains looking for ore and gold, and
            in the evening when they came back home their meal had to be ready. During the day the
            girl was alone. The good dwarfs warned her, saying, <dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="warning">"Be careful about your stepmother.
            She will soon know that you are here. Do not let anyone in."</dialogue></p>

        <p>Now the queen, believing that she had eaten Snow-White 's lungs and
            liver, could only think that she was again the first and the most beautiful woman of
            all. She stepped before her mirror and said:<dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="vain">Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who in this
            land is fairest of all?</dialogue>It answered:<dialogue speaker="mirror" stateofbeing="informative">You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But
                 Snow-White, beyond the mountains With the seven dwarfs, Is
            still a thousand times fairer than you.</dialogue> 
            This startled the queen, for she knew that the
            mirror did not lie, and she realized that<action type="negative" agent="huntsman" receiver="second_queen">the huntsman had deceived her,</action> and that
                Snow-White was still alive. Then she thought, and thought
            again, how she could kill Snow-White, for as long as long as she
            was not the most beautiful woman in the entire land her envy would give her no rest.</p>

        <p>At last she thought of something. Coloring her face,<action type="negative" agent="second_queen">she disguised herself as an old
            peddler woman,</action>so that no one would recognize her. In this disguise she went to the
            house of the seven dwarfs. Knocking on the door she called out,<dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="evil">"Beautiful wares for
            sale, for sale!"</dialogue>Snow-White peered out the window and said,<dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="happy">"Good
            day, dear woman, what do you have for sale?"</dialogue><dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="lying">"Good wares, beautiful wares," she
            answered. "Bodice laces in all colors."</dialogue>And she took out one that was braided from
            colorful silk.<dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="evil">"Would you like this one?"</dialogue> <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="trusting">"I can let that 
                honest woman in,"</dialogue> thought Snow-White, then unbolted the door and bought the pretty
            bodice lace.<dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="evil">"Child," said the old woman, "how you look! Come, let me lace you up
            properly."</dialogue>The unsuspecting Snow-White stood before her and <action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white">let
                her do up the new lace, but the old woman pulled so quickly and so hard that
                Snow-White could not breathe.</action> <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="evil">"You used to be the most
                    beautiful one,"</dialogue> said the old woman, and hurried away.</p>

        <p>Not long afterward, in the evening time, the seven dwarfs came home. How terrified they
            were when they saw their dear<action type="negative" agent="snow_white" receiver="self">Snow-White lying on the ground, not
            moving at all, as though she were dead.</action> They lifted her up, and, <action type="postive" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white">seeing that she was too
            tightly laced, they cut the lace in two.</action> Then she began to breathe a little, and little
            by little <action type="positive" agent="snow_white" receiver="self">she came back to life.</action>When the dwarfs heard what had happened they 
            said, <dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="warning">"The
            old peddler woman was no one else but the godless queen. Take care and let no one in
            when we are not with you."</dialogue></p>

        <p>When the wicked woman returned home she went to her mirror and asked: <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="vain">Mirror, mirror, on
            the wall, Who in this land is fairest of all?</dialogue> The mirror answered once again: <dialogue speaker="mirror" stateofbeing="informative">You, my
            queen, are fair; it is true. But Snow-White, beyond the mountains
            With the seven dwarfs, Is still a thousand times fairer than you.</dialogue> When she heard that,
            all her blood ran to her heart because she knew that Snow-White 
            <action type="positive" agent="snow_white" receiver="self">had come back to life.</action> <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="angry">"This time," she said, 
                "I shall think of something that will destroy you."</dialogue></p>

        <p><action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white">Then with the art of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisoned comb.</action> Then she
            disguised herself, <action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="self">taking the form of a different old woman.</action> Thus she went across the
            seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked on the door, and called out, <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="evil">"Good wares
            for sale, for sale!"</dialogue> Snow-White looked out and said, <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="irritated">"Go on your
            way. I am not allowed to let anyone in."</dialogue> <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="evil">"You surely may take a look," said the old
            woman, pulling out the poisoned comb and holding it up.</dialogue> The child liked it so much that
            she <action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white">let herself be deceived, and she opened the door.</action> After they had agreed on the
            purchase, the old woman said, <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="evil">"Now let me comb your hair properly."</dialogue> 
            She had barely <action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white">stuck
            the comb into Snow-White's hair when the poison took effect, and
            the girl fell down unconscious.</action> <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="evil">"You specimen of beauty," said the wicked woman, "now
            you are finished."</dialogue> And she walked away.</p>

        <p>Fortunately it was almost evening, and the seven dwarfs came home. When they saw
                Snow-White <action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white">lying on the ground as if she were dead,</action> they
            immediately suspected her stepmother. They <action type="positive" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white">examined her and found the poisoned comb.</action>
            They had scarcely pulled it out when Snow-White came to herself
            again and told them what had happened. Once again they warned her to be on guard and not
            to open the door for anyone.</p>

        <p>Back at home the queen stepped before her mirror and said: <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="vain">Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
            Who in this land is fairest of all?</dialogue> The mirror answered: <dialogue speaker="mirror" stateofbeing="informative">You, my queen, are fair; it is
            true. But Snow-White, beyond the mountains With the seven dwarfs,
            Is still a thousand times fairer than you.</dialogue> When the queen heard the mirror saying this,
            she shook and trembled with anger, <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="angry">"Snow-White shall die," she
            shouted, "if it costs me my life!"</dialogue></p>

        <p><action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white">Then she went into her most secret room -- no one else was allowed inside -- and she made
            a poisoned, poisoned apple.</action> From the outside it was beautiful, white with red cheeks,
            and anyone who saw it would want it. But anyone who might eat a little piece of it would
            died. Then, coloring her face, <action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="self">she disguised herself as a peasant woman,</action> and thus went
            across the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs. She knocked on the door.
                Snow-White stuck her head out the window and said, <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="alone">"I am not
            allowed to let anyone in. The dwarfs have forbidden me to do so."</dialogue> <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="evil">"That is all right
            with me," answered the peasant woman. "I'll easily get rid of my apples. Here, I'll give
            you one of them."</dialogue> <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="sad">"No," said Snow-White, "I cannot accept
            anything."</dialogue> <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="evil">"Are you afraid of poison?" asked the old woman. "Look, I'll cut the apple in
            two. You eat the red half, and I shall eat the white half."</dialogue> Now the apple had been so
            artfully made that only the red half was poisoned. Snow-White
            longed for the beautiful apple, and when she saw that the peasant woman was eating part
            of it she could no longer resist, and she stuck her hand out and took the poisoned half.
            She barely had a bite in her mouth when <action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white">she fell to the ground dead.</action> 
            The queen <action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white">looked at
            her with a gruesome stare, laughed loudly,</action> and said, <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="evil">"White as snow, red as blood, black
            as ebony wood! This time the dwarfs cannot awaken you."</dialogue></p>

        <p>Back at home she asked her mirror: <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="vain">Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who in this land is
            fairest of all?</dialogue> It finally answered: <dialogue speaker="mirror" stateofbeing="informative">You, my queen, are fairest of all.</dialogue> Then her envious
            heart was at rest, as well as an envious heart can be at rest.</p>

        <p>When the dwarfs came home that evening they found Snow-White lying
            on the ground. She was not breathing at all. <action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="snow_white">She was dead.
            </action> <action type="neutral" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white">They lifted her up and looked
            for something poisonous.</action> <action type="positive" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white">They undid her laces.</action> <action type="positive" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white">
                They combed her hair.</action> <action type="positive" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white">They washed her
            with water and wine.</action> But nothing helped. The dear child was dead, and she remained dead.
            They <action type="neutral" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white">laid her on a bier,</action> and all seven sat next to her and <action type="negative" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white">
                mourned for her and cried</action> for three days. They were going to bury her, but she still looked as fresh as a living
            person, and still had her beautiful red cheeks. They said, <dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="sad">"We cannot bury her in the
            black earth,"</dialogue> and <action type="neutral" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white">they had a transparent glass coffin made,</action> so she could be seen from
            all sides. They <action type="neutral" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white">laid her inside, and with golden letters wrote on it her name,</action> and that
            she was a princess. Then they put the coffin outside on a mountain, and <action type="neutral" agent="dwarves" receiver="snow_white">one of them
            always stayed with it and watched over her.</action> The animals too came and mourned for
            Snow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and finally a dove.
                Snow-White lay there in the coffin a long, long time, and <action type="positive" agent="snow_white" receiver="self">she
            did not decay, but looked like she was asleep,</action> for she was still as white as snow and as
            red as blood, and as black-haired as ebony wood.</p>

        <p>Now it came to pass that a prince entered these woods and happened onto the dwarfs'
            house, where he sought shelter for the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain with
            beautiful Snow-White in it, and he read what was written on it
            with golden letters. Then he said to the dwarfs, <dialogue speaker="prince" stateofbeing="obsessed">"Let me have the coffin. I will give
            you anything you want for it."</dialogue> But the dwarfs answered,<dialogue speaker="dwarves" stateofbeing="sad">"We will not sell it for all the
            gold in the world."</dialogue> Then he said, <dialogue speaker="prince" stateofbeing="desperate">"Then give it to me, for I cannot live without being
            able to see Snow-White. I will honor her and respect her as my
            most cherished one."</dialogue>As he thus spoke, the good dwarfs felt pity for him and gave him
            the coffin. The prince had his servants carry it away on their shoulders. But then it
            happened that one of them stumbled on some brush, and this <action type="positive" agent="servents" receiver="snow_white">dislodged from
                Snow-White's throat the piece of poisoned apple</action> that she had
            bitten off. Not long afterward <action type="positive" agent="snow_white" receiver="self">she opened her eyes, lifted the lid from her coffin, sat
            up, and was alive again.</action> <dialogue speaker="snow_white" stateofbeing="confused">"Good heavens, where am I?"</dialogue> she cried out. The prince said
            joyfully, <dialogue speaker="prince" stateofbeing="happy">"You are with me."</dialogue> He told her what had happened, and then said, <dialogue speaker="prince" stateofbeing="happy">
                "I love you more than anything else in the world. Come with me to my father's castle. You shall
            become my wife."</dialogue>Snow-White <action type="positive" agent="snow_white" receiver="self">loved him, and she went with him.</action>
            Their wedding was planned with great splendor and majesty.</p>

        <p>Snow-White's godless stepmother was also invited to the feast.
            After putting on her beautiful clothes she stepped before her mirror and said: <dialogue speaker="second_queen" stateofbeing="vain">Mirror,
            mirror, on the wall, Who in this land is fairest of all?</dialogue> The mirror answered: <dialogue speaker="mirror" stateofbeing="informative">You, my
            queen, are fair; it is true. But the young queen is a thousand times fairer than you.</dialogue>
            The wicked woman uttered a curse, and <action type="negative" agent="second_queen" receiver="self">she became so frightened, so frightened, that she
            did not know what to do.</action> At first she did not want to go to the wedding, but she found
            no peace. She had to go and see the young queen. When she arrived she recognized
                Snow-White, and terrorized, she could only stand there
            without moving. Then <action type="negative" agent="unknown" receiver="second_queen">they put a pair of iron shoes into burning coals.</action> They were brought
            forth with tongs and placed before her. <action type="negative" agent="unknown" receiver="second_queen">She was forced to step into the red-hot shoes
            and dance until she fell down dead.</action></p>
