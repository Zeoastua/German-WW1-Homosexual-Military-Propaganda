            not right!</p>
        <p>He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it
            had stained her white stocking all red. Then he turned his horse around and took the
            false bride home again.</p>
        <p>"This is not the right one, either," he said. "Don't you have another daughter?"</p>
        <p>"No," said the man. "There is only a deformed little Cinderella from my first wife, but
            she cannot possibly be the bride."</p>
        <p>The prince told him to send her to him, but the mother answered, "Oh, no, she is much too
            dirty. She cannot be seen."</p>
        <p>But the prince insisted on it, and they had to call Cinderella. She first washed her
            hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down before the prince, who gave her the
            golden shoe. She sat down on a stool, pulled her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and
            put it into the slipper, and it fitted her perfectly.</p>
        <p>When she stood up the prince looked into her face, and he recognized the beautiful girl
            who had danced with him. He cried out, "She is my true bride."</p>
        <p>The stepmother and the two sisters were horrified and turned pale with anger. The prince,
            however, took Cinderella onto his horse and rode away with her. As they passed by the
            hazel tree, the two white pigeons cried out:</p>
        <p>Rook di goo, rook di goo! No blood's in the shoe. The shoe's not too tight, This bride is
            right!</p>
        <p>After they had cried this out, they both flew down and lit on Cinderella's shoulders, one
            on the right, the other on the left, and remained sitting there.</p>
        <p>When the wedding with the prince was to be held, the two false sisters came, wanting to
            gain favor with Cinderella and to share her good fortune. When the bridal couple walked
            into the church, the older sister walked on their right side and the younger on their
            left side, and the pigeons pecked out one eye from each of them. Afterwards, as they
            came out of the church, the older one was on the left side, and the younger one on the
            right side, and then the pigeons pecked out the other eye from each of them. And thus,
            for their wickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness as long as they
            lived.</p>
