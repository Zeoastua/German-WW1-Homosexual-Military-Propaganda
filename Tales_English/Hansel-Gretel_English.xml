    <story>
        <p>Next to a great forest there lived a poor woodcutter with his <character
                child-status="stepmother" marital-status="wife" reference="evil-stepmother"
                >wife</character> and his two children. The boy's name was Hansel and the girl's
            name was Gretel. He had but little to eat, and once, when a great famine came to the
            land, he could no longer provide even their daily bread.</p>
        <p>One evening as he was lying in bed worrying about his problems, <dialogue
                speaker="husband, father" stateofbeing="negative"> he sighed and said to his
                    <character child-status="stepmother" marital-status="wife" reference="wife"
                    >wife</character>, "What is to become of us? How can we feed our children when
                we have nothing for ourselves?"</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="wife" stateofbeing="negative">"Man, do you know what?" answered the
                    <character child-status="stepmother" marital-status="wife" reference="wife"
                    >woman</character>. "Early tomorrow morning we will take the two children out
                into the thickest part of the woods, make a fire for them, and give each of them a
                little piece of bread, then leave them by themselves and go off to our work. They
                will not find their way back home, and we will be rid of them."</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="husband,father" stateofbeing="negative">"No, woman," said the man. "I
                will not do that. How could I bring myself to abandon my own children alone in the
                woods? Wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces."</dialogue></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="wife" stateofbeing="negative">"Oh, you fool," <character
