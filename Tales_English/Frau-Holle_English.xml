        <p>
            <act type="being" effect="ambiguous" agent="widow">A widow had two daughters, the one
                was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy.</act>
            <act effect="ambiguous" type="being" agent="widow">She greatly favored the ugly, lazy
                girl, because she was her own daughter.</act>
            <act type="doing" agent="pretty girl" effect="hostile">And the other one had to do all the work, and be
                the Cinderella of the house.</act></p>
        <p>
            <act effect="hostile" agent="pretty girl" type="doing">Every day the poor girl had to
                sit by a well, next to the highway, and spin so much that her fingers bled.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="pretty girl">Now it happened that one day the
                reel was completely bloody, so she dipped it in the well, to wash it off, but it
                dropped out of her hand and fell in.</act>
            <act effect="hostile" type="doing" agent="pretty girl" receiver="widow">She cried, ran
                to her stepmother, and told her of the mishap.</act>
            <act effect="hostile" agent="widow" type="doing" receiver="pretty girl">She scolded her
                so sharply, and was so merciless that she said,</act>
            <dialogue speaker="widow" stateofbeing="negative">"Since you have let the reel fall in,
                you must fetch it out again."</dialogue></p>
        <p><act effect="hostile" type="doing" agent="pretty girl">Then the girl went back to the
                well, and did not know what to do. Terrified, she jumped into the well to get the
                reel. She lost her senses.</act><act effect="benevolent" type="doing"
                agent="pretty girl">And when she awoke and came to herself again, she was in a
                beautiful meadow where the sun was shining, and there were many thousands of
                flowers. She walked across this meadow and came to an oven full of bread.</act>
            <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="bread" receiver="pretty girl">The bread
                called out</act>, <dialogue speaker="bread" stateofbeing="negative">"Oh, take me
                out. Take me out, or I'll burn. I've been thoroughly baked for a long
                time."</dialogue>
            <act effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl" type="doing" receiver="bread">So she stepped
                up to it, and with a baker's peel took everything out, one loaf after the
                other.</act></p>
        <p><act effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl" type="doing">After that she walked further
                and came to a tree laden with apples.</act>
            <dialogue speaker="apple tree" stateofbeing="negative">"Shake me. Shake me. We apples
                are all ripe."</dialogue>
            <act effect="hostile" agent="apple tree" type="doing">cried the tree.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl">So she shook the tree until the
                apples fell as though it were raining apples. When none were left in the tree, she
                gathered them into a pile, and then continued on her way.</act></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl">Finally she came to a small
                house.</act>
            <act effect="ambiguous" agent="old woman" type="doing">An old woman was peering out from
                inside.</act>
            <act effect="ambiguous" type="being" agent="old woman">She had very large teeth,</act>
            <act effect="hostile" type="being" agent="pretty girl">which frightened the girl,
                </act><act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="pretty girl">and she wanted to run
                away.</act> But the old woman called out to her,<dialogue speaker="old woman"
                stateofbeing="positive">"Don't be afraid, dear child. Stay here with me, and if you
                do my housework in an orderly fashion, it will go well with you. Only you must take
                care to make my bed well and shake it diligently until the feathers fly, then it
                will snow in the world.* I am Frau Holle."</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="pretty girl" io="old woman">Because the old
                woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took heart, agreed, and started in her
                service. The girl took care of everything to Frau Holle's satisfaction and always
                shook her featherbed vigorously until the feathers flew about like snowflakes.
                Therefore she had a good life with her: no angry words, and boiled or roast meat
                every day.</act></p>
        <p><act effect="hostile" agent="pretty girl" type="being">Now after she had been with Frau
                Holle for a time, she became sad.</act>
            <act effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl" type="being">At first she did not know what
                was the matter with her, but at last she determined that it was homesickness.</act>
            <act effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl" type="being">Even though she was many
                thousands of times better off here than at home, still she had a yearning to
                return.</act>
            <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="pretty girl" receiver="old woman">Finally
                she said to the old woman,</act><dialogue speaker="pretty girl"
                stateofbeing="negative">"I have such a longing for home, and even though I am very
                well off here, I cannot stay longer. I must go up again to my own
                people."</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><act effect="ambiguous" agent="old woman" type="doing">Frau Holle said,</act>
            <dialogue speaker="old woman" stateofbeing="positive">"I am pleased that you long for
                your home again, and because you have served me so faithfully, I will take you back
                myself."</dialogue>
            <act effect="benevolent" agent="old woman" type="doing" receiver="pretty girl">With that
                she took her by the hand and led her to a large gate.</act></p>
        <p><act effect="benevolent" type="doing" agent="gate" receiver="pretty girl">The gate was
                opened, and while the girl was standing under it, an immense rain of gold fell, and
                all the gold stuck to her, so that she was completely covered with it.</act>
            <dialogue speaker="old woman" stateofbeing="positive">'This is yours because you have
                been so industrious,"</dialogue>
            <act type="doing" effect="benevolent" agent="old woman" receiver="pretty girl">said Frau
                Holle, and at the same time she gave her back the reel which had fallen into the
                well.</act></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl">With that the gate was closed
                and the girl found herself above on earth, not far from her mother's house.</act>
            <act effect="ambiguous" agent="rooster" type="doing">And as she entered the yard the
                rooster, sitting on the well, cried:</act></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="rooster" stateofbeing="positive">Cock-a-doodle-doo, Our golden girl is
                here anew.</dialogue></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="pretty girl">Then she went inside to her
                mother, and as she arrived all covered with gold, she was well received, both by her
                mother and her sister. The girl told all that had happened to her, and when the
                mother heard how she had come to the great wealth, she wanted to achieve the same
                fortune for the other, the ugly and lazy daughter.</act>
            <act effect="hostile" agent="ugly girl" type="doing">She made her go and sit by the well
                and spin. And to make her reel bloody, the lazy girl pricked her fingers and shoved
                her hand into a thorn bush. Then she threw the reel into the well, and jumped in
                herself.</act></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="ambiguous" agent="ugly girl">Like the other girl, she too came
                to the beautiful meadow and walked along the same path.</act>
            <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="ugly girl" io="bread">When she came to the
                oven, the bread cried again,</act>
            <dialogue speaker="bread" stateofbeing="negative">"Oh, take me out. Take me out, or else
                I'll burn. I've been thoroughly baked for a long time."</dialogue></p>
        <p><act effect="ambiguous" agent="ugly girl" type="doing">But the lazy girl answered</act>,
                <dialogue speaker="ugly girl" stateofbeing="negative">"As if I would want to get all
                dirty," and walked away.</dialogue></p>
        <p><act effect="hostile" agent="apple tree" type="doing">Soon she came to the apple tree. It
                cried out,</act><dialogue speaker="apple tree" stateofbeing="negative"> "Oh, shake
                me. Shake me. We apples are all ripe."</dialogue>
        </p>
        <p><act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="ugly girl">But she answered,</act>
            <dialogue stateofbeing="negative" speaker="ugly girl">"Oh yes, one could fall on my
                head,"</dialogue>
            <act effect="ambiguous" agent="ugly girl" type="doing">and with that she walked
                on.</act></p>
        <p><act type="being" effect="ambiguous" agent="ugly girl">When she came to Frau Holle's
                house, she was not afraid, because she had already heard about her large
                teeth,</act>
            <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="ugly girl">and she immediately began to work
                for her. On the first day she forced herself, was industrious, and obeyed Frau
                Holle, when she said something to her, because she was thinking about all the gold
                that she would give her. But on the second day she already began to be lazy, on the
                third day even more so, and then she didn't even want to get up in the morning. She
                did not make the bed for Frau Holle, the way she was supposed to, and she did not
                shake it until the feathers flew.</act>
            <act effect="hostile" agent="old woman" type="being">Frau Holle soon became tired of
                this</act>
            <act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="old woman" receiver="ugly girl">and
                dismissed her of her duties.</act>
            <act effect="hostile" agent="ugly girl" type="doing">This was just what the lazy girl
                wanted, for she thought that she would now get the rain of gold.</act></p>
        <p><act effect="ambiguous" type="doing" agent="old woman" receiver="ugly girl">Frau Holle
                led her too to the gate.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="gate" receiver="ugly girl">She stood beneath
                it, but instead of gold, a large kettle full of pitch spilled over her.</act>
            <dialogue speaker="old woman" stateofbeing="negative">"That is the reward for your
                services,"</dialogue>
            <act agent="old woman" type="doing" effect="hostile">said Frau Holle, and closed the
                gate.</act></p>
        <p><act agent="ugly girl" type="doing" effect="hostile">Then the lazy girl went home,
                entirely covered with pitch.</act>
            <act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="rooster">As soon as the rooster on the well
                saw her, he cried out:</act></p>
        <p><dialogue speaker="rooster" stateofbeing="negative">Cock-a-doodle-doo, Our dirty girl is
                here anew.</dialogue></p>
        <p><act type="doing" effect="hostile" agent="ugly girl">And the pitch stuck fast to her, and
                did not come off as long as she lived.</act></p>
