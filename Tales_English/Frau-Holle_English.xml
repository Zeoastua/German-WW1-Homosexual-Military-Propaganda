    <story>
        <p>A widow had two daughters, the one was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and
            lazy. She greatly favored the ugly, lazy girl, because she was her own daughter. And the
            other one had to do all the work, and be the Cinderella of the house.</p>
        <p> Every day the poor girl had to sit by a well, next to the highway, and spin so much that
            her fingers bled. Now it happened that one day the reel was completely bloody, so she
            dipped it in the well, to wash it off, but it dropped out of her hand and fell in. She
            cried, ran to her stepmother, and told her of the mishap. She scolded her so sharply,
            and was so merciless that she said, "Since you have let the reel fall in, you must fetch
            it out again."</p>
        <p>Then the girl went back to the well, and did not know what to do. Terrified, she jumped
            into the well to get the reel. She lost her senses. And when she awoke and came to
            herself again, she was in a beautiful meadow where the sun was shining, and there were
            many thousands of flowers. She walked across this meadow and came to an oven full of
            bread. The bread called out, "Oh, take me out. Take me out, or I'll burn. I've been
            thoroughly baked for a long time." So she stepped up to it, and with a baker's peel took
            everything out, one loaf after the other.</p>
        <p>After that she walked further and came to a tree laden with apples. "Shake me. Shake me.
            We apples are all ripe." cried the tree. So she shook the tree until the apples fell as
            though it were raining apples. When none were left in the tree, she gathered them into a
            pile, and then continued on her way.</p>
        <p>Finally she came to a small house. An old woman was peering out from inside. She had very
            large teeth, which frightened the girl, and she wanted to run away. But the old woman
            called out to her, "Don't be afraid, dear child. Stay here with me, and if you do my
            housework in an orderly fashion, it will go well with you. Only you must take care to
            make my bed well and shake it diligently until the feathers fly, then it will snow in
            the world.* I am Frau Holle."</p>
        <p>Because the old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took heart, agreed, and started in
            her service. The girl took care of everything to Frau Holle's satisfaction and always
            shook her featherbed vigorously until the feathers flew about like snowflakes. Therefore
            she had a good life with her: no angry words, and boiled or roast meat every day.</p>
        <p>Now after she had been with Frau Holle for a time, she became sad. At first she did not
            know what was the matter with her, but at last she determined that it was homesickness.
            Even though she was many thousands of times better off here than at home, still she had
            a yearning to return. Finally she said to the old woman, "I have such a longing for
            home, and even though I am very well off here, I cannot stay longer. I must go up again
            to my own people."</p>
        <p>Frau Holle said, "I am pleased that you long for your home again, and because you have
            served me so faithfully, I will take you back myself." With that she took her by the
            hand and led her to a large gate.</p>
        <p>The gate was opened, and while the girl was standing under it, an immense rain of gold
            fell, and all the gold stuck to her, so that she was completely covered with it. "This
            is yours because you have been so industrious," said Frau Holle, and at the same time
            she gave her back the reel which had fallen into the well.</p>
        <p>With that the gate was closed and the girl found herself above on earth, not far from her
            mother's house. And as she entered the yard the rooster, sitting on the well, cried:</p>
        <p>Cock-a-doodle-doo, Our golden girl is here anew.</p>
        <p>Then she went inside to her mother, and as she arrived all covered with gold, she was
            well received, both by her mother and her sister. The girl told all that had happened to
            her, and when the mother heard how she had come to the great wealth, she wanted to
            achieve the same fortune for the other, the ugly and lazy daughter. She made her go and
            sit by the well and spin. And to make her reel bloody, the lazy girl pricked her fingers
            and shoved her hand into a thorn bush. Then she threw the reel into the well, and jumped
            in herself.</p>
        <p>Like the other girl, she too came to the beautiful meadow and walked along the same path.
            When she came to the oven, the bread cried again, "Oh, take me out. Take me out, or else
            I'll burn. I've been thoroughly baked for a long time."</p>
        <p>But the lazy girl answered, "As if I would want to get all dirty," and walked away.</p>
        <p>Soon she came to the apple tree. It cried out, "Oh, shake me. Shake me. We apples are all
            ripe."</p>
        <p>But she answered, "Oh yes, one could fall on my head," and with that she walked on.</p>
        <p>When she came to Frau Holle's house, she was not afraid, because she had already heard
            about her large teeth, and she immediately began to work for her. On the first day she
            forced herself, was industrious, and obeyed Frau Holle, when she said something to her,
            because she was thinking about all the gold that she would give her. But on the second
            day she already began to be lazy, on the third day even more so, and then she didn't
            even want to get up in the morning. She did not make the bed for Frau Holle, the way she
            was supposed to, and she did not shake it until the feathers flew. Frau Holle soon
            became tired of this and dismissed her of her duties. This was just what the lazy girl
            wanted, for she thought that she would now get the rain of gold.</p>
        <p>Frau Holle led her too to the gate. She stood beneath it, but instead of gold, a large
            kettle full of pitch spilled over her. "That is the reward for your services," said Frau
            Holle, and closed the gate.</p>
        <p>Then the lazy girl went home, entirely covered with pitch. As soon as the rooster on the
            well saw her, he cried out:</p>
        <p>Cock-a-doodle-doo, Our dirty girl is here anew.</p>
        <p>And the pitch stuck fast to her, and did not come off as long as she lived.</p>
