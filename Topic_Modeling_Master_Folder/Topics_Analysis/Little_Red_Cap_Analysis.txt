Little Red Cap Topic Modeling Analysis

English
The topic model presented two sets which spoke closely to the tale. Specifically, they were:
3	0.25	grandmother's beautiful straight flowers lying early public manner grab god knocked ground sunbeams place bushes hazel there's 
9	0.25	wolf's cuts fell yesterday full boiled frightened crying shining belly scissors occurred aim horribly hands inside

These sets detail the tale's investment in the fate of the wolf, which is cut open with
scissors, with little red cap and the grandmother freed from the inside. It also speaks to
the way in which little red cap is directed to go to her grandmother's - to not stray from
the straight path. However, she does so and is distracted by flowers in the wood.

German

This data set runs in parallel with the English tale sets, specifically as to the wolf
eating the grandmother and little red cap, as well as the distracting flowers which leads
to little red cap's demise.
