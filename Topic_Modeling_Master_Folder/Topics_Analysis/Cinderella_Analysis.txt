Cinderella Topic Modeling Analysis

English

9	0.25	festival side mother toe put piece knife dirt wickedness favor pulled washed answered sister past feet usual prince embroidered covered 
10	0.25	dance dress partner danced hand bird asked astonished magnificent ride immediately beauty appeared approached slippers coming parlor daughters 

These two sets detail the tale's investment in the position of Cinderella as a mai for her 
house, as well as her ability through the help of magical allies such as the birds to enter
into the ball and be amongst the beauy and opulence while also being beautiful herself. It

to cutting parts of their feet in an attempt to fit into the Cinderella's slipper.

German
The topic model presented three sets which spoke closely to the tale. Specifically, it was:

6	0.25	pantoffel sen stiefmutter aufb rufen schnei passe begraben ngte mpchen gestorben hrte sche ausbleiben still schwiegen gings

of Cinderlla as dirty and beautiful. However, the German topics are slightly more invested

Cinderella's ability to play the role of maid for her family as well as suitor to the
