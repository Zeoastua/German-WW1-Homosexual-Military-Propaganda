The Twelve Brothers Topic Modeling Analysis

English
The topic model presented two sets which spoke closely to the tale. Specifically, they were:
17	0.25	fire died crying joy daughter oil innocent lit slander began helped show kissed long face give castle great 
18	0.25	shirts great girl wife day bride head beauty promise meet coming evening father named kingdom child 

These two sets detail the tale's investment in where the daughter ends up in the tale,
specifically the slandered wife to a king, and her mission to save her brothers once they
become cursed. It also shows the investment in the punishment given to the king's mother,
who, as described in the topics is put into burning oil. However, the topics do not invest
in the brother's murdering of girls, which is odd given the tale's continued insistence
on the practice.

German
The topic model presented one sets which spoke closely to the tale. Specifically, it was:
13: gerade erstes umsonst sprichst hohe spazieren unverdrossen hemdlein geschenkt bruder redlich knie schwert gekommen acht gingen kinder leben  

This one set details the way in which the brothers are uncursed, specifically through the 
little shirts that the brothers (as birds) fly through. The other topics don't seem to find
anything else that stands out in the German original of the tale.
