When utilizing topic modeling for this project, the team envisioned that the results would point to what the tales are about, getting at themes of positivty or negativity, values and morals, and other things that may not be immediately visible to analysis. 
With this hope in mind, we ran topic modeling, and instead of receiving data that touched on broad themes, the exact opposite happened. The topics that were produced were strikingly similar to individual tales, so much so that they don't speak to the corpus we
analyzed as a whole. For example, topic 0 of the English topics is a condensed version of Hansel and Gretel, and topic 3 of the German topics is a condensed version of Aschenputtel(Cinderella). Because of this, the topics that were created, but do not seem to be
productive in furthering analysis on our research question. However, it does provide some insights as to what the tales are invested in, and how they may differ.

What was made clear through the topic modeling is that the tales are heavily invested in the characters themselves, and it is the named characters and individuals found within them that make up a bulk of the differences one can find. This is striking, though
understandable, as the tales themselves often speak to similar themes and work in similar ways. Part and parcel of these tales is that young people are put into precarious situations, often due to some break in kinship (such as the evil mother/stepmother figure)
and come out of the situations matured and with some degree of autonomy. The difference between the tales depends on the individual characters and the particularities of their actions and behaviors. Therefore, seeing the topics hone in on those individual 
characters makes clear sense.

However, if this project was not created and executed within the timeframe of a semester, there are avenues of change that could make topic modeling possibly more productive. For example, it could be productive to standardize all proper nouns in the tales,
stripping the named individuals of that particular difference so that topic modeling software doesn't find that "Hansel" or "Gretel" is useful data. Another method could be to work with kinship terms and characters that function as kin. For example, in the tales
in our selected corpus, individuals named as stepmother, queen, and sorceress all function as the archetypal evil stepmother. By collapsing all of these characters into one term, topic modeling could more easily dive deeper into the texts and provide models
that do not give surface-level analyses of difference. 

While the team hoped for more with topic modeling, we are happy to see work done with this technology and the potential it provides. We are also glad use the data we do have to draw some conclusions, mainly that the tales do not differ strongly; they seem to 
follow similar themes and narratives due to the topics' investment in named characters instead of other difference. Because of this insight, the team has chosen to include our findings.
